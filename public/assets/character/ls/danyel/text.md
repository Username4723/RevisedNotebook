# Powers

**Understanding of Light**. While Danyel isn't great at mathematics, his ancestry gives him the ability to understand how light, especially UV light, works, nearly flawlessly. However, applying this knowledge in practice is prone to errors, and is no replacement for a proper education.

**Hard to Burn**. Helios has to drive the chariot of the sun, which can get quite hot. While immunity to flames is not something Danyel possesses, he can be exposed to regular flames for up to a few minutes before starting to burn. Naturally, hotter flames burn him faster.

# Biography

Danyel embraced his ancestry from the day he suspected it. In school, he excelled in sports and chose to study engineering. To keep himself busy, he also learned a few minor pyrotechnics, such as playing with solid-fuel rockets. Before going to college, he volunteered as a firefighter due to his resistance to flames, though in an incident involving faulty PPE, he was burned severely while trapped in a collapsing building. In university, he chose to study engineering, and currently works as a solar engineer.

His locket is currently unopened, sitting somewhere in a box in his apartment, as he has not finished moving in.
