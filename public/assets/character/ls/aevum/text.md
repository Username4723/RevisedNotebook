# Biography

Aevum hasn't done anything too remarkable. They went to school (although they skipped classes left and right to do whatever they felt like), managed to scrape a pass, and moved out as his relationship with his family was mediocre at best. they currently don't have any long-term plans, just coasting for place to place doing whatever they feel like, whether it be camping in the mountains for a week without telling anyone or swimming out to sea in a thunderstorm for the hell of it.
