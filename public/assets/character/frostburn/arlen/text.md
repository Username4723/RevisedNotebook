## Power: Copycat

The user can copy another's magical abilities via physical contact. However, this is only temporary - while the original caster can recover stamina, a user of Copycat cannot unless they copy the power all over again, similar to the difference between a rechargeable and disposable battery. In addition, the user cannot hold more than one power at a time, and the copied power is normally weaker than the original.

However, this power does not come with the skill to use it effectively. Powers that the user hasn't practiced with would need to be learned from scratch. Currently, Arlen is excellent with a healing power, along with basic water and ice powers. In addition, Arlen knows how to use shapeshifting abilities - and often prefers the form of a green wyrmling and to fly around.

These abilities may need to be adjusted for actually being in coombat.

# Personality

Arlen is generally quiet at first, but if you get to know him a bit, he'll open up a bit. While originally he regarded his power as a curse due to how society interpreted it (and he still slightly does), he has mostly grown to accept his ability. He's generally a fast thinker and very quick on his feet.

If you find Arlen just out and about, he'll likely be sitting in a tree with his backpack, humming a small tune to himself. Oftentimes, if startled, he'll fall out of his tree and land on his backpack (His poor backpack's normally the victim of several accidents). He'll always prefer a good chat to anything, though.

As a side note, Arlen is notoriously bad at cooking. Think along the lines of <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-lOOUqmyY>, but through sheer ignorance

# Backstory

Arlen was born to a working class family in a small riverside fishing town. They were by no means poor, but by no means rich either-they supported themselves via their fishing, and no more.

It was only when a mage came to his school that Arlen accidentally copied his power-and even then, he didn't realize it until he blasted himself out of a tree. Quickly after that, he was left his family to go study magic in a city - he was sad at first, but quickly learned how basic explosion magic worked under a mage. This was later undone once he accidentally stumbled into a lightning mage.

It took a few tries, but eventually Arlen figured out his true power-Copycat. It was hard to find a person to train him, as it was a somewhat uncommon ability and not one widely popular at that. However, he eventually learned to somewhat control it. There were a few incidents, however. Arlen occasionally copied a power without knowing it, and wouldn't find out until later. There were times where he went to heal someone, but shocked them instead or vice versa. It was at this time that Arlen was concluding his secondary education, and being confused on where to go, decided to try and find a university to master his power at to ensure he could use it well.

Eventually, after graduating university, Arlen took a field agent job at a paranormal agency. Swiftly working his way through the ranks, he often has several issues with his subordinates - if they dislike one of his decisions, they'll declare him possessed and intervene on their own, causing all sorts of messes for Arlen to get himself out of.
