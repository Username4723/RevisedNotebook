## Power: Illusions

Siceo has mastered the skill of illusions, and can create illusions in a place he can see of up to about a cubic meter at a time, or higher if he is entirely still and focused. The illusions can create sound and the feeling of temperature, but physical interaction with the illusions reveals them to be false.

After training, Siceo is able to produce extremely vivid illusions, such as a couple walking down the street and chatting.

## Anti-Power: Positron

If Siceo touches any device that requires electricity, the device inexplicably breaks in a way that repairing it would cost at least as much as buying a new device. Any microphones or cameras that try to capture him either find him silent or invisible. Rarely, the device will fail catastrophically, such as taking down power for the current building or catching on fire.

# Backstory

Siceo is a very quiet person. Though he has good intentions, he does not trust other people with his secrets. He keeps a journal on him at all times, and while he is normally calm and quiet, attempting to read or steal his journal angers him nearly immediately.

In addition, Siceo has always been under immense pressure (read: abuse) to succeed, along with immense pressure to "fit in", whether that be in grades, life, or similar. After he accidentally led to his parents being arrested, custody of him was released to the state, and the pressure on him was lifted immensely. After his parents died in prison, their estate was passed to him, mostly because they did not have time to remove Siceo from their will after they were arrested and before they died

He went to law school, as while he could live hundreds of lifetimes coasting off the interest of his parents assets. while at first he continued because he still felt pressured, as time passed, he started believe that he could make a change in the world with his resources, and make the future one worth fighting for.

However, he found infuriating hatred for the supernatural, which were always beyond justice. No amount of legal paperwork could subdue an angel, and no amount of laws could outwit a devil. Siceo currently is employed at a paranormal control center, tracking down (and often bringing to justice) flout the law as written. Through his job at the agency, he is able to take command of nearly any investigation, and will not rest until the case is closed.
