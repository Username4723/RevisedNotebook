# Backstory

At a young age, Aspen ran away from their hometown at a young age due to a rough family situation. They took refuge in a shallow cave in a forest, surviving on a day-to-day basis. During winters, he often went hungry for days on end before finding food. Over the years, he retained the ability to read and write, though it takes him longer than normal to do so due to a lack of practice.

## Notable People

Friends, family, past partner(s), etc.
