## Powers

### Immortality

Vianola cannot die except by her own willing choice. In addition, she will not age past the age she acquired immortality. To die, Vianola must pass on the blessing or curse of immortality to another (there is no range, only that Vianola is acquainted with the recipient) - the recipient will be aware of their new status and how to pass it on, along with who passed to them. Vianola will then resume her mortal lifespan. The recipient and Vianola will be linked, with each always knowing the location of the other.

It's important to note that Vianola does not have supernatural healing. Any injuries she sustains will heal at the rate a normal injury would. This means that some wounds that would not heal without Vianola seeking medical attention, and if a would leaves her unable to seek aid, she may be stuck waiting to be discovered by a passerby and hope they seek aid on her behalf. In addition, most modern pharmaceuticals work on her, meaning that she could use them to treat an illness, or that she could be drugged and locked in a box and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

In addition, Vianola's pain tolerance is remarkably low. While she may not be able to die from a scratch, she will not withstand much pain before surrendering, even though she knows she is immortal. She can still be knocked out and still needs to sleep, and is horrid at staying conscious.

For example, if Vianola was diced into tiny pieces and scattered to the wind, not only would she fall unconscious from the pain, but she would also not heal if somehow all the pieces were reunited - a healer would have to reconnect every nerve, every blood vessel, every bit of skin, and only then would she have a chance of healing.

### Lucid Dreamer

Vianola can control her dreams to her liking, force herself to dream when she falls asleep, or wake from a dream at any time. In addition, she normally maintains a one-to-one ratio of dream time to real time, instead of a single small dream taking hours in reality.

## Backstory

Vianola was raised in a small fishing town on the ocean, and while there was mostly enough food to go around, everybody had to play their part in order to eat. Nobody save children, the sick, the elderly, and those unfit to work were able to eat without doing their fair share - there was simply not enough food to go around otherwise.

From a young age, Vianola imagined a better world, a world where nobody had to worry about their next meal, a world where everybody was safe, a world where everybody could be themselves. She took to writing this world in her diary, since nobody would entertain her ideals of a utopia.

Vianola started to dream when she slept - she found it remarkably simple to control a world in her dreams, and started building her utopia there, away from the problems of reality. She played the role of a citizen in the world she created, and in time, grew far more attached to it then any world she ever created.

She lived a second life in her dreams - a life where she didn't have to worry about the problems of reality, a life where she could be herself without restraint. She wrote about her life in secret, and often wished she could bring the paradise of her dreams to reality.

In the real world, Vianola eventually went out to sea on a fishing trip. However, a storm capsized the boat, and everybody went overboard. She grasped onto a spare piece of driftwood, and let it carry her away, to a place she didn't know. Nobody else survived the storm.

When Vianola awoke, she was in a small tent, a young man in adventuring gear standing over her. She was weak, and couldn't talk, but she was alive. The young man explained that he found her on Death's doorstep on the beach, a piece of driftwood on her back. He explained where they were - nowhere near Vianola's home, and no chance of returning home. Not that she would - most of what she cared about was in her dreams, and what wasn't was on the ship.

It was only after Vianola healed and parted ways with the adventurer that she noticed her diary was missing, though she was unsure why. Having no choice, Vianola took to a life on the roads, finding work where she could to survive.

She was almost 14 by now. She retreated further into her dreams, only staying awake to work so she could feed herself. Her world had grown into a paradise, where everyone could live their dreams to the fullest, including her. Her world was her passion, her goal, her reason for existing.

Until one day, one of her jobs went wrong. She was being paid to escort some cargo, and she found the adventurer that saved her only a year or two before. They acknowledged eachother, but nothing more. And then the job went wrong. Bandits attacked, and Vianola had been knocked out. The adventurer was nowhere to be seen, only leaving behind a bloody mess.

He was presumed dead, but in her sleep, Vianola felt something change. She had been given the ability to persist, to no longer die. When she awoke, she found her diary next to her, with a small note.

_"If you're reading this, I'm most about to die. I apologize for taking this from you, and even more for reading it. It was wrong of me, and I knew it, but I still did it. I've most certainly been captured and mutilated, and I'm probably in pieces, but not yet dead. To end my suffering, I've given you the power that I never had the heart to use. Build us a better world."_

Vianola, having her diary back, immediately updated it. Re-reading it, she was reminded of a simpler time, a time when reality was all that mattered. She decided, for a week, to return to reality, simply to remember how it felt. Within a month, she was no longer spending all her time in a dream.

She decided to build the better world she designed, starting one step at a time. However, she knew not where to start. She knew the end goal, but not how build a path to reach it.
