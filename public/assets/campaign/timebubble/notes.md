A time bubble was formed in the middle of a city, about a mile radius. In the bubble, time doesn't flow and everything is frozen.

Scientists are able to poke small holes in the bubble. Nobody has managed to reach the center.

The party is working for an organization trying to investigate the bubble. Anyone who touches the bubble takes 200 years of aging damage.

This organization is headed by Mary, a level 20 pacifist, and Rodriguez, a Spark.

The party was given 200 gp each and sent to find equipment. [TODO: Decide on a name] pillaged a few abandoned houses cut in half by the time bubble, finding a rusty dagger.

Eventually, everyone met up at a shop, where the party bought 10 daggers, some swords, a health potion, and [TODO: Decide on a name] bought a backpack.

Lily's Character (Lvl3 C:? R:? B:? G:?) managed to seduce the shopkeeper for a discount, along with the fact that we were in a party to remove the time bubble.

John's Character (Lvl3 C:rogue R:goliath B:Sneak Attacks G:m) decided to try and threaten the shopkeeper, who called down a tiger pet. [TODO: Decide on a name] went to pet the tiger, who was hesitant at first, but reluctantly allowed it.

It was also revealted that health potions were nearly sold out, due to the discord in the town.

Eventually, everyone meets up in the cafe next door, where some characters buy bread, and my character get a free bag of cat food for the tiger. Mary calls everyone back to the lab for being late, and [TODO: Decide on a name] drops off the cat litter.

Rodriguez wants a character to shoot a raygun he developed to poke holes in the bubble, but my character opted to tie a rope to the gun and shoot it from a distance, to which Mary remarks [TODO: Decide on a name] has a level head on their shoulders.

Lily's Character (Lvl3 C:? R:? B:? G:?) manages to seduce Rodriguez.

A Jagermonster near the edge of the bubble is decided to be acting as a test subject. One team enters the bubble for a day, which is 6 minutes real time, to move the Jagermonster. The team [TODO: Decide on a name] is in is to poke a hole in the bubble and move the creature.

Rodriguez, for some reason, needs to build another raygun, and is motivated by my character remarking that if he finishes fast he might get lucky.

Inside the bubble, the party runs into a shadowy creature who knocks out several members. The raygun is revealed to be two-handed, and acts as a means of damaging the creature. The team runs, at Rodriguez's decision, as he recognized them.

The team returns with lots of scientists and rayguns. The party gets to the Jagermonster while the scientists fend off lots of shadows.

The Jagermonster wakes up in crazed mania, and has to be fought. Eventually, it comes to its senses.

My character casted Detect Magic during the battle, and it revealed the bubble is magic. This made my character very suspicious.

My character thinks that a raygun couldn't affect magic, and that Rodriguez is a magic user tied to the bubble somehow.

Cultist party returns to real world meeting bubble party inside the bubble. Jagermonster is knocked out, and shadows are still mildly interested.

John steals (and places back) the hat from the Jagermonster.

8 scientists are dead, and 20 are alive.

John tears out the sword from the Jagermonster's chest and tosses it to Tory, who catches it. It is revealed all the Jagermonster's belongings disintigrated.

John tries to carry the Jagermonster out, only to take 5 damage from their mutated hair.

# REF!

After half an hour (and only 5 surviving scientists), everyone reunites at the lab.

Mary walks out with an extremely worried look. She can tell that someone is new, and says "Please, don't screw up, and please, don't be an idiot." Rodrigues tells Mary the shadows got everyone else.

Mary's expression drops: "So, this is it? 5 idiots and ..."

# REF!

[TODO: Decide on a name] asks to copy spells from Rodriguez's spellbook, who responds 'Spells? What spells?' and my character can't tell if they're lying.

Mary and Rodriguez attempt to drag the Jagermonster into the science building, attracting stares as the lab is part of a college.
