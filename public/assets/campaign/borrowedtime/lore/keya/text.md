# Story

He was a Rogue, at most 17\. She was a Sorcerer, nearing her 16th. He was mischevious, always in need of a laugh. She was kind, always looking for someone to help. He was shy, never going out of his way to socialize. She was outgoing, always surrounded by friends. They were opposites, in every way possible. Together, they were perfect. Years passed. They went on adventures. They dated. They married. They saved the world. They grew old together. Eventually, he died. She grieved for days unending. In the last few days before she dissapeared, she wrote to her best friend, stating she would do anything, would pay any cost, just to turn back her clock and see him again. -Mendel's Fables, Tale of Two Heroes

# Awakening

She woke in a field, knowing nothing but a name. She wasn't even sure it was her name, but it felt familiar. She knew naught how she arrived in the field, nor where she was. In the distance, the stars shed light upon a town, which she would soon learn was called Allyon. It was starting to rain, so she headed there, still unsure of who she was. Her memory was cloudy, like the sky above. She wandered to the inn, in need of a place to stay while she sorted her inner turmoil. She didn't seem to notice people staring at her pointed ears along the way. She paid for her room with her bracelent, an adamantine masterpiece that should have been worth a King's ransom. The innkeep told her not of this though, and pocked the bracelet, giving her a run-down and poorly kept room. -Bill's Observations

# Memory

He was an intriguing figure, having arrived in town just days before the Rain. He seemed to project an aura of sadness, as if he had sinned past repentance and then came to his senses. He was only ever seen for minutes at a time-one could blink and he'd vanish. Nobody had ever heard him speak, nor had anybody ever seen his face. What a truly mysterious figure... -Collection of Reports from the Town

# Behavior

She was a curiousity, always walking around with a distant gaze and a blank face. While she wasn't deaf, she seemed to barely register when people were talking to her, and did't notice at all when people stared at her pointed ears. The few times someone got her attention, she opened her mouth to say something, but then closed it again, as if she didn't remember how to talk. -Bill's Observations
