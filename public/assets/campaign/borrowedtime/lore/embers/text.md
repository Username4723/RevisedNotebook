# Empty Outpost

It was an empty town, made fully out of prisine marble, intricately carved. While it was windy and cold outside, the moment Tome stepped into the city, a warm breeze comforted him. Even though the sun was warm overhead, the city was empty. Not a single person was in sight. Upon closer inspection, some of the buildings seemed to have cracks in them, and some paths were covered in small amounts of moss, as Nature slowly retook the city. -Peter's Observations

# Actual Tome

Half the book was written in the arcane language that Spellcasters used to transcribe their magics. The other half was written in what appeared to be an ancient form of Common, even older than renowned playwrights such as the mythical playwright Stillsword. The Tome was ancient at best-ink was faded to the point of illegibility and some of the pages crumbled into dust after just a touch. In the very last page, an icon was inscribed-and in the icon, a map. -Peter's Observations

# Blood Moon

Far outside the Ancient City lied a small camp. A figure lay asleep in the tent, a small book next to them. Outside, the moon shone brightly, with a red tint. If the figure awoke and looked, the icon on the last page of the book would be shining gold with the warmth of the sun. However, the figure continued to sleep, unaware of the shifting sky overhead. -Unknown
