# Keya
Mindless slaughter... without mercy...
Their blood... on my hands...
Who am I? Who was I?
Like Atlas... holding the sky...
A simpler time... cost of dispair...
I couldn't save Ral...
Who was Ral...?
I couldn't save Amaris...
Who was Amaris...?
I must not lose focus.
- Monologue of the Fragment

# Ral
Could I be something more..?
My memory is blank...
A cruel fate...
A half-shattered mind...
Part of a larger whole...
A curse gone wrong...
The damned wristband...
Just a memory...
