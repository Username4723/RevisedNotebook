# Wristband

The wristband was pure adamantine, inset with several gems. On its own, it would be worth a king's ransom. It was cursed, however. Long ago, sealed within lie a demon, lying dormant. The wristband was eventually rediscovered by a warlock, who accidentally set it free. It killed hundreds, until the Hero, Keya, singlehandedly slew it. -Legend
