# Food

Food was starting to run scarce. With the Rain, fishing at the docks was no longer safe - the was an everlasting threat of a wave to drag fishermen off the docks and into the thick of the storm. With this, people slowly started to use their spare food. Families rationed, barely satisfying their stomachs. One such family was Tirell and Solange, and their son, Kester, along with their adopted daughter. They were poor even before the Rain, but when they ran too low on food, they had to cut costs-they kicked their adopted daughter to the streets and split the food she would have received between themselves. -Rumors overheard by Mira

# Keya

She walked around Allyon, gaze blank. People noticed she didn't fit in-her simple white dress much finer than anything they wore, her exotic red eyes speckled with gold, and her pointed ears were just a few of the things people noticed. From the sky, a warm breeze descended for a brief second. She looked to the sky, and smiled. -Rumors

# Community

The people of Allyon were a generally open community. Everyone knew everyone-there was little one could do without it being common knowledge within the end of the week. There were few visitors besides the occasional lost and bruised traveller - the town would generally keep them for a day to let them recover and then send them on their way with directions. -Jessica's Observations

# Nicholas

Nicholas walked down the street, book in hand. He was no more than 12, but regardless, he was already one of the most clever boys in town. His knowledge, though, did not come with the wisdom to use it for good. He often orchestrated cruel pranks on the other boys, finding enjoyment in their suffering. Just today, he tripped somone in a black cloak and stole her book while she was down, replacing it with a decoy to avoid suspicion. However, Nicholas was not wise enough to know his limits, and his antics would eventually catch up to him. -Mira's Observations

# Nicholas's Father

It was a day or two after the start of the Rain. It wasn't too terribly bad, but already the sea was churning. A fisherman was standing out on the dock, watching the storm. Minutes later, a wave had swept him into the sea. By the time anyone heard his scream, it was too late for him. -Bill's Observations

# Framer

## Rose & Milton

Rose was a bit tired, but nevertheless she tended to her garden like normal. It's been years since she last picked up her bow, having retired years ago, but her hands were still steady; she had not let her old age affect her in the slightest. While the Rain made her garden difficult to tend to, she never gave up, not even once. From behind her, a shadow slipped out from behind a tree. A figure approached Rose from behind. When she next awoke, she found herself relieved of her gold wristband, the last remnant she had from her long-departed husband. The next day, Milton, son of the Blacksmith, had a new gold ring. -Mira's Observations

## Rumors

It was a curious thing-Some people reported thefts of the worst kind. They would be tending to their lives, relaxing, and then the next thing they knew, they were waking up on their back, as if they were knocked out, and only later realizing something important was missing. This thing would never be anything too valuable, but it would always have some sort of sentimental value. It would always break the heart of whoever it was stolen from. -Jessiva's Observations

# Innkeeper

innkeeper: a generally nice fellow. he doesnt charge that much-the inns a side business. its just you and one other person in the inn. you know this other person exists, and you've seen her in the corner of your eye maybe once or twice

The Innkeep was a tad bit annoyed. A fisherman by trade, he was unable to perform his job-the Rain made going to the docks nearly impossible without getting swept out to sea. The Inn provided some gold (or some artifacts that nobody could spare the gold to buy in these troubling times), but it wasn't enough to keep him fed. In times like these, the Inn still charged for rooms for those who could afford to pay, but waived the cost for those who couldn't, knowing the town would pay him back in time. -Bill's Observations
