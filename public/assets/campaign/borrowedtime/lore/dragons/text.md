# Creation

The world came from nothing, and in time, will return to nothing. From the nothing rose three beings of immense power - they could create whatever they desired, or destroy it just as easily. In time, they created a world. A world of magic, adventure, and possibility. Each of the Three created a different piece - Tyrra made the sand and the dirt and the air, creating a terrain of vast peaks and crests. Wyve breathed life into the world, capable of imagination just as she was. Fyre provided the balance between the two, ensuring that none broke the other, and even letting their creations mingle from time to time.

Their work done, the three created twelve, tasked with maintaining the world and letting it grow, spreading its metaphorical branches to form a beautiful tree. Each of the twelve was given a wristband to identify them with, as they were mere replicas of eachother - without a name and without a face. The twelve scattered to various corners of the world, breathing magic into it and letting it grow. It is from this that the life Wyve made and the matter Tyrra made united, forming the first physical beings. The Twelve would guide them along their own paths, each gowing in ways the others could not expect. It is from this that the divide among the Humanoids was created, and from this that powerful beings such as Dragons arose.

Their work done, the Twelve eventually vanished from the world. It is suspected that most of them have renounced their positions and faded to the afterlife, along with the Three. The world came from nothing, and it will return to nothing. The world is living on borrowed time, delaying its end.

Names vary across languages and religions, but the same entities seem to be referred to (the names provided are the Draconic equivilent of the most common names.)

# Ages of the World

A long time ago, before current times, the world was rich with magic and energy. Spirits and animals lived together in peace and balance. Magic threaded the world in such abundant amounts that even those untrained could weave it to their will with just a thought. This was before the departure of the Fifteen, and after they left, the magic of the world started to fade.

It wasn't quick, but over time, the magic of the world faded. Without the Twelve keeping balance, kings started warring to hoard the fading magic. Some used it to longer their lives, while others used it as a deadly weapon to settle old grudges. No mortals could wield it to its full potential, nor could they hoard it within themselves - those who tried often burned themselves up from the inside. During the wars, the spirits fled the world, retreating from the bloodshed and horror.

A few wise mages sought to store the magic into crystals, which they embedded into powerful magical artifacts. Eventually, the constant warring sapped the magic of the world dry. By the time the current era arose, ambient magic had dissipated to the point that no mortal was skilled enough to use the traces, and most mages had no choice but to use their innate life force to power their spells.
