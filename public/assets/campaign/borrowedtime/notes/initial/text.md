# Full Notes

Mira and Lilian share that thefts have been happening around town-Mira calls killing the person who it is. The Party is introduced to the Memory-and Mira immediately notices he doesn't leave footprints. Mira investigates the wristband that the Fragmant sold to the innkeeper, and finds its valuable.

They share info about the Fragment. The go to her room. Mira knocks, and notices the light of a candle. Lilian knocks, announcing her position. Peter tries to roll to doubt. Bill and Lilian send out their familiars and see the Fragment, staring into space.

Mira and Peter go out to the alley, using a Wand of Secrets. Peter finds nothing. Behind them, Peter spots the Memory leaving, wearing a black cloak and a dagger at his wrist. Mira suggests going to Nicholas and retrieving a book from them, since Nicholas tripped the Memory and stole its book. Mira was wearing a black cloak, so pretended to be the Memory.

Nicholas lived at the edge of town with his mother. His father died at the docks due to the storm causing winds and waves. Nicholas apologizes to Mira, and hands her the book, which is revealed to be Bill's copy of Faraday's Journal.

Bill searches his room, and finds his other soul notes missing. He sees his spellbook opened to the page on Wish, which is an impossible spell for mortals. Mira climbs into his room via the window, and comforts Bill.

Meanwhile, Peter tries to enter the Fragment's room via the window. The fragment notices. She goes to leave the room, and Peter hides behind the door. Everyone notices this.

Mira trails the Fragment on rooftops, hidden from view, while the party trails her on foot. She doesn't react. She reaches the edge of town and proceeds to start walking into the storm, paying no attention to the party as they try and stop her, eventually tackling her and casting suggestion on the Fragment to force her to spend the night in the barn.

While the party was doing this, a dark flash struck from the storm far past the other side of town. The party and the Fragment went to the Barn for the night, where Peter tested her by exposing her to badly-smelling Copper, to which she stepped back.

Eventually, the party rested. In the morning, Brian pinched the Fragment, who was met with a response of lightning overhead. He tried again, only for nothing to happen.

Mira and Bill eventually break into the Fragment's room, only to find it empty. They see the Memory walking down the stairs, and Mira goes to block the door while Bill fetches the party.

Mira asks the Memory questions, to which they are unable to find the answer. They do have a dagger they pulled out, though. The rest of the party arrives. Peter attempts to enter through the door that Mira was blocking, opened it a bit, and then Mira slammed it shut, sending the handle straight to where it would hurt the most.

Everyone but Mira enters through the window - Peter throws the foul-scented copper at the Memory, and it passes right through his head, starting to cause them to slowly vanish.

Eventually, the Memory fades out of existence. Bill asks for any info about soul-trapping, and is told the story of a King who sealed his soul in an Adamantine necklace, only for it to get stolen. The story states that a mortal has to willingly offer their soul-no other mortal can rip it from them against their will.

We end in the barn discussing this

The Fragment runs off - John uses his coin to allow her to escape, and Bill buries the coin. Brian uses Command to halt her - and Mira suggests Brian tie her up like a leash.

Bill cuts the rope. She leads everyone to the southern end of town - knee to waist height grass, and the storm intensifying 25 minutes out.

Bill convinces Mira to allow the Fragment to sprint into the storm. Mira gives Bill 50 ft rope, a torch, a tinderbox, and a day of rations, and Bill lets Mira borrow a Greatsword +1\. Peter creates an Eldritch Cannon thing.

Bill, holding her hand, chases the Fragment about 15 minutes out, with Mira. The fragment stops dead in her tracks, and Bill casts Detect Magic, detecting the Fragment is casting a mix of shield/attack magic.

Bill casts Protection from Good and Evil, and the rain lightens up just a bit. They see figures in the distance, Mira gives back the Greatsword.

Bill and Brian stay behind with the Girl, and everyone else goes to the four figures.

Mira and Peter go against the 3 Specters, and Lilian goes against the Wight. The Fragment runs towards the town. In the town are two more specters.

Eventually, Mira befriends a Specter. The Fragment, Brian, and Bill kill the two specters in the town (with the sponsor using weak and not-well-controlled magic to do so), and Lilian tries to lead the Wight back to Mira and Peter.

Peter and Bill discover that fire has a chance to stun the Specters, and while Lilian tries to lead the Wight, it life drains her in the back while she's not looking.

The Wight and all the specters die but the befriended one, which lingers, freed from the Wight's control. They all return to town.

In addition, one of the Specters was revealed to be the Innkeeper - the wristband was looted, and Peter put it on, barely succeeding a save.

The wristband is destroyed, and while discussing things, the Specter can write information down and doesn't know too much. The Memory is seen, but vanishes.

At the table, Mira admits to having a grudge and all day tomorrow she'll be busy tracking someone down. Mira tells her the story about him stealing a bracelet and making it into a ring. Bill looks at Peter and inspects him for a ring.

She'd prefer to do it solo as it's a little personal. She accepts Bill's familiar Leaf going with him

The Specter (named Crone) states his first memory was somewhere to the west. The party, except for Mira, goes west.

Bill realizes he was being left alone with Peter and Brian who he doesn't like much, but Mira, seeing this, goes with the party to the West.

Brian whispers to Bill, "Should we tell em" about the Girl using Magic. Bill says "Tell them about what" (loudly). Brian wants to leave her somewhere.

Bill loudly states she has magic, but it was really really bad. Brian shares she struck him with lightning.

Bill gets a moderately large Peter on sorcery. Peter inquires whether to leave Crone with the Fragment, and Peter offers to stay with them.

Bill stays back to babysit them, while the rest of the party goes out west, while Mira instructs Crone to protect the Fragment and Bill.

Bill refuses to translate for Peter, as Peter pulled his tail.

They see the Necromancer's summoning ritual, and get 10 minutes from it. Mira's theory is people will be drawn to the spot, killed, and resurrected.

They kill the necromancer, and the Fragment nat 20s her save, and wakes up only to run off after not recognizing anyone.

Mira goes to trance Milton and brings him to the docks. He doesn't know much about the ring or anything, and is then drained and yeeted into the ocean.

Bill sends his familiar to loot the body later and finds bite marks - he then concludes that Mira's a vampire.

Mira, meanwhile, notices the Fragment crying on the cliffs. She races up the cliffs but gets a nat 0, and the Fragment jumps up and dies.

Bill casts Gentle Repose on Keya, and the session ends.

Next session, everyone reunites at the Inn, and opts to explore the ruins of the Necromancer more. Behind the area, they find the hut of the Twins (Corlyn and Alilvi), who greet them casually. They claim to feed off of people who try and kill them and die in the process, and take shelter from the rain outside of town for obvious reasons. They seem to have a different copy of one of Bill's books, and give it to him out of good faith.

# Meta

Chris creates the theory that the Fragment was the Sorcerer, who sold her soul in order to see the Rogue again.

Chris creates the theory that the Fragment and the Memory have to meet for the Fragment's mind to be restored.

One specter crit Mira leaving her with about 4 hp. It would have been an insta kill but I "forgot" (decided last second to avoid a player death) I gave vampires resistance to necrotic.

The save was a high DC intelligence save, to which Peter got a Nat 20\. Anything less would have been a new character.

Bill theorizes she was born from the storm and therefore has storm sorcery.

# Unsharable

The Fragment left due to a beacon placed by the Remnant outside of the storm - the Fragment detected it.

During the rooftop scene, Mira left to find the Blacksmith's son, who was not at home at the time.

Also, this happens while Bill and Lilian are running around town. I'll whisper to her. "This is going to be weird, but I need your help with something. I need some food and I have no where else to get it. Please understand. I won't hurt you any more after this. I just need to stay in the game to figure out what's going on. And yes, we will find your soul and get it back. Just please don't tell anyone about this..." I'll drink a little blood from her, biting on the forearm near the shoulder, under her shirt. After that, I'll take some wraps and wrap it up.

What's left of the Fragment's mind, after being ripped apart by the Remnant, is currently holding off the full might of the storm - the first pinch was a surprise most unwelcome.

This is completely wrong. The Memory is the Fragment's subconsciousness going off on its own-creating the equivalent of a Simulacrum with 1hp.

Free Lore goes here.

Befriends = puts in a trance

The Wight's life drain was actually nerfed here.

This would have been a knockout (almost insta kill), but Mira, being a vampire, has resistance to Necrotic damage.

Feeblemind, DC above the sky.

And so she can drink his blood.

Mira charms Crone to hide near the inn.

Outside the session, Bill contacts Embers for the first time through his book, and Embers answers with vague descriptions about themself.
