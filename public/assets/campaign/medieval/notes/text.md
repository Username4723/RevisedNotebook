The Elder and Besmith are friends

Besmith is dead.

Czergald - BBEG

Magest - Hero that stopped Czergald before.

Orchard is the bear that can talk after eating honey

Rodriguez - Scribe

Llama is Alex - Still with us, old man traveller because the old one died

Dalton - Dark Elf, very suspicios, just arrived above ground days ago

Dalton sees a town, and the rest of the party races. My character decides to walk instead. Dalton does not like running.

We arrive at the gates of the town called Llam. It seems run down, like in an old west movie. Streets are dusty, and there are 2-3 story buildings. There's a tumbleweed, and a child chases it.

Everybody goes to the Marketplace except Michael, who goes on a different path. Dalton takes a liking to Elizabeth, and states the runned-down buildings are nicer than the underground

Michael says God sent him, and Dalton asks "Which One", to which Michael says random draconic ("The Dragon God Hot Dog Water").

Everyone goes to a bridge. A man says "Don't [sneeze] on it". Elizabeth bounses on the bridge, and falls into the river after it breaks somewhat. Dalton saves her, and she flirts. Dalton pretends not to hear it, and pulls Elizabeth off the bridge.

We walk to split paths. One goes to a market, the other to a farm. John chooses market, and drags everyone with them. The streets are dusty, but the houses are a little nicer. Tents are in a cobblestone circle, with vendors.

Dalton still has 20 gold pieces that he stole from his mom, and 15 gold from each brother. My character buys a book from an old lady for 10g, in exchange for advertising. Michael buys a storybook, and Elizabeth buys a picture book. John tries to reach for Elizabeth''s pockets for fish, and Dalton sees, but John dismisses it. Jessica tries to buy a random book, but it turns out to be about the great dragon wars. It's in Draconic

Elizabeth gives Dalton her happy book, and Dalton reads it while walking.

John looks for a weapon shop, and finds one looking like it would fall apart. It has axes in it. A short dwarf dramatically welcomes them to the shop. John goes to a different weapon shop, bringing everyone. A man is behind the counter, reading a scroll. John tries to use Thieves Cant, and failes. The man has greatswords, shields, a fishing pole, etc. Elizabeth buys the fishing pole for 15 GP.

John looks for double bladed swords, but finds broken swords. The shopkeeper has a tiger named "Fluffy" which John knows (Metagaming). The tiger brings out Fluffy, who walks out. Dalton tries to pet Fluffy, who goes up to him and purrs. My character tries to pet Fluffy, who attacs (2 damage)

John buys Smiths Tools for 10g. My character asks about the runned-down state, and gets told the town wasn't completely burned down in the war. John buys a crossbow for 15g (+10 bolts)

My character asks about Rodrigues, to which the shopkeeper calls him a nutjob who seems to think science is a thing, who dealt with fish and had a fish farm. He hangs out near the temple. John asks for potions, and the owner replies in theives' cant. John tries to stealthily move to the alchemist's for potions, and Dallton notices his absence.

John goes for a bed, trying to lift it up for a location. The old man (drunk) tells him, "Not that one!". There's a trapdoor under another, and John goes down. An arrow barely goes past John's ear. John goes down stairs, lighting a lantern. Down a latter, there's a figure at a desk with a man behind it. He buys a poison apple, 2 poison potions, and a sleeping potion for 60 gold total. Back on the surface, Jessica goes outside and buys a doll from a small girl for 5g, after bartering down for 50g. The doll is named "Pig"

Elizabeth is taken by the Rock of Absent Characters

John goes outside and fails to find a dark weapon market. He asks the dwarf with axes for double-bladed weapons, who doesn't have one. John doesn't buy an ax. Michael finds a pet shop with a caged owl in its window, with a (10 year old) brother + sister pair talking in unison welcoming them. They have bugs, and their father is catching a tiger. Michael buys a walking stick from them for 20g out of pity.

Everyone rendezvous. John takes a screw and I take 2 screws and a tiger tooth from broken theives tools.

We get lost when trying to go to the temple. The temple is across a river, and Jessica tries to Moses the water. She gets a 9\. John tries to jump on a roof (Nat 20) and jump across the river (20). He succeeds.

Everyone else crosses bridges. Michael and I see a figure run behind a house. Michael yells, "Please come out, random stranger!". The bottle drops from Elizabeth on the rock of falling characters. John catches it.

The temple is a large Japaneese style building with golden columns and a red roof. A man goes through the doorway, wearing safety goggles. Rodriguez recognizes the bottle, and is shocked when Jingyow is destroyed. Rodrigues says "Damn it, that fish..." only to dismiss it.

Dalton looks around. Rodriguez talks about fish, books, etc. after being filled in. Rodrigues says he's researching "History and... and... nevermind." Mary comes from the enterance, and demands an explanation, and gets one.

My character mutters a reference to Lily's seduction last campaign, earning a glare. The llama spits at Rodrigues, earning a "Bad dog." Everyone follows Rodriguez. He's talking about quantativity.

John asks about ranged weapons. Rodriguez says no, but my character notices something is off. We arrive at a polished white building. There's a bunch of white shelves, and Rodriguez states they're marble. My character asks about sturdiness, and gets told it's not flammable. John sees daggers, what seems to be health potions, worn out coats, and a crossbow.

My character makes a reference to a raygun, and Rodriguez states it seems interesting. John asks about guns, and Rodriguez will make a prototype.

My character asks for a lot of info, "We make our own funding _winks_," noting they put snakes near a corner to spook horses and similar. He seems interested in magic, but can't cast any. Deception: 9\. My character believes it.

Rodriguez messes with John's crossbow, and makes it into a double-decker crossbow.

Rodriguez mentions a wizard that went through town and grew a sapling, and asks if my character is a wizard, and my character pulls out a staff.

Rodriguez is hated by the blacksmith for "borrowing" a forgery kit. Rodriguez noticed John's knife up his sleeve, offering lockpicks. John takes 1/2 a tinkerer's tools.

Next Session - the Rock of Absent Characters abducts me. Alissa fills me in (and I shamelessly copy-paste her explanations)

> Rodriguez and Marry wanted to see if the party was loyal enough before they told them anything, so they sent them out on a fetch quest to hijack a bank carriage and steal the gold in it, then give it back to the lab so Rodriguez could afford some new (rather expensive) equipment for experiments. Also to upgrade the lab in general. Rodriguez told the party to head to the pet shop, where the twins running it would have some rattlesnakes. There was a whole "coal beetle" escape thing, but they settled that quickly. They got three rattlesnakes and set off.

> They made it to the road and John sat in a bush and waited. They saw a carriage coming (not the bank one) but John rolled a Nat 1 on investigation, so I forced him to go for it anyway. One lost snake, a crashed carriage, five copper pieces and a dead body in a ditch later they were back in play. Another one went by, but they didn't stop it. Then, the bank one came by and John threw both snakes at it, spooking the horse and scaring the driver off. The thing didn't crash, so they chased it and Aliissa [sic, replaced] rolled a Nat 20 on animal handling, so now she has a horse.

Then some bandit gang called "The Thorns" tried ambushing them, but John rolled a Nat 18 in intimidate. When they were steering the carriage away, another bandit group (rivals of the Thorns) called "The Bloomers" started chasing them on horse back after Elizabeth insulted the leader's girlfriend and his dead mother. A chase happened, Jessica fell off the roof of the carriage, as did Michael, but they made it back okay. Jessica may or may not be carrying the unconscious body of The Bloomers Leader.... and that's where we stopped.

Stuff happened. A rogue leader was captured. A rogue leader left the stage. John tries to get another horse. John sees a sketchy guy at the center, and Elizabeth goes to see Rodriguez. Someone trips John when he goes to the sketchy man. The person is revealed to be Mary, who calls him back to the lab. Mary tells John not to get involved with the spooky guy, as he's extremely bad news,

After tons of pestering, Mary asks Tam for a flamethrower, which is all used up, and Tam goes to refuel it. In exchange for shutting up for a month, Mary tells John that the man murdered someone but nobody can prove it.

Reagan is introduced to Mary, who demands 20 gp for joining. Mary states to reach Gazmald, players need to go up north Garnebal road to reach Mazkith, which is a port town. There's a lake, Gazmald on the north side (secluded), and need to get to Mazkith to take a boat. Rumors of orc killings and sea monsters sinking boats. Mary explains that a bottle with a red orb in it, which is used to communicate. The bottle means that signs (such as the black dragon, red bottle) (blue bottle - in care of Minth in Gazmald) of the dark wizard returning are showing.

We all make our way to Carnebal road, going North to Mazkith, with thick, dispicable looking clouds, churning over a mountain range. Alissa does a hidden roll when we are in the carriage, and earns "Not that face!..."

We recon to before the grey thing. Elizabeth is repalced with Bailey. Charles falls out of the sky. A dimensional rock of new character drops out of the sky with him. We all get back to the laboratory, with Mary looking concerned. John walks up, and says "Boo" to her face, who reacts iffy. She says something happens and ushers her inside. She never has been this concerned before. We all

A new hole was scorched into the lab roof, about 5x5 feet. Rodriguez is pacing back and forth with a pale face, trying to dismiss it as an experiment that blew up. My character believes him. Rodriguez thinks that my character PROBABLY doesn't remember the war.

Rodriguez reveals that the dragon wasn't a coincidence, and that Czergald was the only wizard powerful enough to summon one, but remarks that he doesn't know if he's a wizard. Nobody suspected he was gone for good, and that Czergald had a scrying spell that was amplified, and a message bottle was setup to avoid it.

Bailey causes Jessica to blush by seducing. My character tries to hush Rodriguez from talking about bottles in case of listening, but Rodriguez interrupts him.

Bailey tries to seduce Rodriguez, who gets a nat 1\. Mary punches his head, shoves him against the wall, threatening to snap everyone's wrist.

The green in Witherwater, yellow in Evernhale (Dale), and purple somewhere and an unpronounceable name. The blue bottle (in Gosmald) from Minth arrived. A traveller brought it to us.

The second and after it had a ball (green, yellow, red (red is worst)), and the red bottle was in it. It came via a note and no explanation. We are sent to Gosmald. Mary snaps Bailey's wrist for not shutting up.

John tries to snap it back into place, and somewhat works. Bailey persuades Rodriguez for cool gadgets, who goes to the back to puke. He comes back with a double-decker crossbow and bolts.

Dalton throws a fork at Bailey to IRL insanity, who takes no damage.

John finds a house that seems nobody is in it, and sneaks inside, entering via a window, and drawing a :) on the window. John feels the urge to sneeze, and covers his mouth. There is a single chest, which John goes to, and finds its a mimic.

The first of John's dagger hits, one hit killing it. John stabs a door. Door screams. Door bleeds. Door slams John. Door misses. Door is stabbled. John is slammed. Mimic is stabbled. Mimic dies. John eats a squished cockroach, and manages to fight off the poison for now.

I find a burned-down library (burned 5 years ago), and there's a women in the square selling books, according to an old man. There's also a a story of Abolith, to which I take out notes.

"Paste Alissa's story here.

"A few months into the war, a wizard, much like yourself, came into the kingdom, calling himself Abolith. No one knew where he came from or what his real name is, but he offered his assistance in defeating the Dark Wizard. I'm not one for long sSarahes, so I'll just give you a synopsis. He disappeared after talking with the hero Magest, and then The Dark Wizard disappeared as well, and that's the last anyone ever saw of him. A strong magic user, he was... or so I've heard.""

"There are also rumors from the military:

""1\. Magest is dead and Czergald will return!!! (Pessimistic people)

1. Magest killed Czergald

2. Abolith possessed Magest and made him fight Czergald

3. Abolith was actually working with Czergald and Magest killed them both

4. The entire story is a fib made up by people wanting attention (very rare, definitely not true, made by people who would think the moon landing was fake)

5. Czergald lost his nerve and fled, leaving his army behind

6. Czergald was possessed by something, making him attack and start a war

Czergald is biding his time after killing Magest and Abolith and is gaining his strength to return.

Abolith and Czergald are the same person.

Had to get those two in. Also, Magest is that one hero dude that disappeared along with Abolith and a day later, Czergald did too."""

Bailey, concurrently, angers the axe-selling dwarf, and attempts to seduce, and manages to dodge a playfully swung ax. Bailey walks away and throws a dart past the Dwarf's ear, who looks back, thinking it is a mosquito.

Bailey goes back to the Shopkeeper, and buys a shortsword for 5g, and attempts to buy the tiger, and then gets chased out, as the Shopkeeper said Bailey was a shoplifter. Fluffy knows otherwise, and playfully scratches Bailey.

Michael goes to the shop, and admits he's not willingly in a group with Bailey, sells his stolen rapier (stolen from Bailey) for 10g

John and Charles go to the blacksmith, and see a dwarf hammering metal. A young elven woman comes out, and Charles asks for daggers. John buys some shurikens, and then antagonized the shopkeeer, who hits John with a hot hammer.

We all smell something rancid from the grass, and Charles runs near it. It smells like something dead. Charles goes to investigate. There is a half-rotting buck carcass. John feels a little sick from the cockroach.

Some noises are from the shrubbery. A hyena-like humanoid figure jumps out of the bushes. There are 8 gnolls.

The gnolls die to shatter. Jeffry is a Clidestale Thouroghbread breed. John takes first watch, and I cast alarm. Later, I'm waken up by bush ratteling, which is flesh blobs. John tames one and puts it in a carrige. The underbellies seem to kill things on touch. I shatter 7, which explode to goop. The moss in the area dies. The goop is pretty much acid.

The group flees. I find info about the blobbermouth in my book about the 110 year war. It was summoned. Apparently Czergald was the best summer ever. They are the results of failed summons (x100) from other planes. I fail to convince John to kill the thing.

I take a long rest. Jeffery and Alex start looking around. Jeffery rears up, but fails. Jeffery starts galloping, and things get bumpy. Everyone wakes up. A fairly large brown bear is galloping towards us with its mouth open.

Elizabeth sees someone on an armored horse galloping towards us, who turns around and we are side by side. They're a half-orc. We direct them to Llam. We are told that bears normally don't want to attack people, and are told that a lady in Earvenhale. The message is a glass bottle.

The bottle has an orb in it. We cannot tell what color.

The liquid from Blob starts to make an imprint on the carrige flor, which is metal. The liquid is hard to grasp. There are white stones and multicolored flags. One of the guards looks at us, points us at it, and demands our purpose

The guards let us in, and say "You look a little not smart", pointing to Elizabeth. Mazkith is named for its white stones - marble, granite, and other white rocks. Lots of people are in the streets.

I ask if Elizabeth is going to a pet shop since she got tired of Jeffry, who is outraged. Elizabeth loses badly in an arm-wrestling. The entire right side of town is the marketplace. The upper district is near the boat district.

The drawf that guides us is Magerick. I get to a library, while John goes to an inn. Elizabeth goes to a pet shop. The church is in the residential zone. The librarian is in armor. They seem to have a section in the back-left, with two bookshelves. One of the two books is history, and the other is research.

John goes to the White Hatchet, a weapon shop owned by a dwarf. John buys a bit of stone armor for 50g. Elizabeth rides to John to say she needs armor. Nearly all the floor of the carriage is covered by Blob's acid

Elizabeth buys the armor for 90 gold because John likes to scam. I gain Darkness from the library. The church Charles is in is empty. There's a statue of a spider deity. All of us hear a loud voice (magical) telling us to get to the center town sqare. It mentions that this is not a drill.

Alex stomps Blob. Elizabeth picks us all up and brings us all to the center of town. People all wonder what's happening. Apparently there is a town attack where a dangerous situation is outside of the town.

A monster blockade is outside the town. There is a giant melted hole in the wall. The thing has to do with fire. From across the town, there's screams and a crumbling wall. Jessica rides a horse, and everyone else goes onto the wall.

The wall is somewhat-solidy squishy magma, that's mosly dry. On the rim, what looks to be a sea of fire exists. John suggests evacuing the town, and the guard leaves to see the commander.

Over our heads, a jet of fire spews. 3 magma mephits (flying fire goblins) appear. From the book, they are weak to water. There's horses galloping towards us, with some singed.

Magma mephits are immune to fire and poison. The cavalry is trying to distract the methods to not shoot at the wall.

The wall we were at has gone _boom_. The mephits fly into the city. The guard says they can't evacuate as ferries are closed. The ferries are closed in the middle of the lake. It's just _gone_. Magma slugs are surrounding Jessica, and the horse is gone. Elizabeth kicks down the rest of the wall and runs out.

Michael and Charles go outside the wall. I set off an alarm bell with Minor Illusion. The guard runs. Jeffrey is a quarter way around the city. John bails, running back to the carriage. Jessica leaves, and the Rock of Missing Characters takes a slug with it.

There is a sea of civilians running towards us with water buckets. The magma slugs can merge.

3 years ago, the city burned down, and took books with it. Marissa is the Guard's superior.

I point out that without records the boat can't be assumed as sunk. I decide retroactively what I tell the guard about the magmas.

John tries to shove a sleep potion down the mouth of a shopkeeper, and gets stabbed instead, and chased away.

Michael finds Jeffrey, who knows what he's done. John returns to the Carriage, and Alex is trying to kill Blob again.

Elizabeth buys hay for Jeffrey, and Elizabeth is bald. John goes to the Alchemists to sell Blob, and John says where Blob was found (in the forest), which is now on fire as an idiot left a burning campfire there. John sells the Blobbermouth for 50g.

Charles and Michael go to the church. A random Sarah appears in the church, and laughter appears as she mocks everyone's stupid decision. Michael uses Detect Animals or Plants and finds a tiny spider.

Sarah steps towards them like an Elf on the Shelf. As Charles lights a torch, it seems things are going away from the light. Sarah steps into the light. Michael and Charles go into the church. There is a sticky looking web below Michael's foot, who pulls back their foot. A screech is heard from somewhere, seemingly from the corner of the room. Into the light comes a giant spider.

Sarah has to go IRL, and sneaks back into the darkness like an edgy teenager. I fill Rodriguez in on what happens. Sarah's character tells everyone to get to the church. There's a Large spider sitting in the corner. The spider looks confused.

Michael uses Aninal Handling, and the spider isn't hostile. It asks why we're here, and it says "Why you here?", and requests the party leave. Michael relays this to the party. We all leave the church.

A guard shoos me off from a military library. John looks for a syringe in the main marketplace, and nobody knows what it is.

John overhears two guards walking down the street, talking about "They still haven't found it yet?" and similar. John asks them about that, and talks about that one boat that "supposedly" sunk in the middle of a lake. My character overhears it. The guards give the party directions to the dock.

We go to the docks, and Alex beat us there. The party enters the boathouse, and removes kids from petting Alex. Charles gives them rations. Charles asks about building boats, and is shot down by John.

John asks about renting a boat, and is told the ferry is canceled. John asks about buying or renting, but is told no. John sees a line of boats, with 3 children (that were on Alex earlier) on one, some shining theirs, etc.

There is a grand total of 2 vacant sailboats. I ask about cargo boats, but the NPC is asleep, and Jessica uses Shape Water to wake them up. All the cargo boats were canceled to normal, regular whirlpools, and cargo boats (such as to Gazmald) don't take passengers except crew. We are told about boats (3 capacity comfortably, entire party uncomfortably) that are never used and vacant. We're given directions to a shabby boat, owned by Loxodon (who hates water, and hasn't used it). Charles tosses him a ration, and he is thankful.

Jessica is the only person with boating experience, due to being a water genasi. John unties the knot. John plots the route, going in a small arc around the center of the lake. There skies are a beautiful blue, and Jessica thinks the boat looks like a hunk of junk. Jessica fixes up the boat with a Nat 20.

She fixes up quite a lot of the boat, and names the boat the S.S. Alex. Alex makes little uncomfortable noises as the waves rock the boat, and Alex goes below deck. We're in the middle of the lake, and can hear running water.

We look to the side of the boat, a little too late. There's a massive whirlpool right in front of us. Jessica uses Shape Water to move the boat away from the whirlpool. It seems to be slowly working, and we leave the whirlpool.

Michael fails to notice bubbles floating up from the bottom of a lake, and the boat goes over it. A whirlpool opens under the lake, and Jessica fails to steer the boat over. We are sucked under the waves.

We reach solid ground. Darkness surrounds us, the boat landing with a thunk. John and Charles pull out lanters and torches. The walls pulse with some dark energy, and the roof closes up. John looks for a way out, and sees some water pooling under our feet. The walls look slightly pink.

There are a few lumps here and there, and it smells terrible. John sees a small sort of tunnel leading what he presumes is out, but it is a little bit clogged up with something that smells rancid.

John stays on the boat. The stomach is slightly filled with water. John lightning breaths the thing, and we hear a high pitched moan, slightly screaming. The walls close on on eachother. We go through the slightly clamped tunnel.

Alex refuses to leave the boat. We hear the rushing of water. A huge tide of water falls down. Charles is slammed into a wall. John and I get back into the boat. Charles pokes the hole, and the thing screams. Walls seem to be trying to push us forward. John and Charles pour acid on the hole. The thing vomits us back up.

Charles and Michael are swept up and vomited up, soaring through the air. What swallows us surfaces beneath John, where Michael and Charles. The boat manages to stay afloat. It has a torn sail and is taking on water.

The thing looks like a giant round blue whale with 2 antlers off of the back. It circles, and starts moaning. John tries to swim over, and get on it. He succeeds, and nat20s to calm it down. It seems content now. It sees Alex struggling to get off but unsure whether to leap.

Alex and I join them on the whale thing and climb onto its back. John tries to direct it, and fails. Michael uses Speak with Animals to tell it to head to Gazmald, and the thing asks why we would go there.

We are told that there's nobody left to talk to. We are told that they are simply gone. I fill in Rodriguez, and am told that it will be a while for a response. Michael drops rations into the water for rations, and eats them. We get soaked.

We get there after a short rest, and try to get off near the coast. The whale whines tentatively and starts to turn around. John starts rubbing it, and it slowly shakes its head.

John suggests we get catapulted. We all get close enough to swim. The whale's not experienced, and we go 5 feet in front of the whale due to a lack of experience. John starts to swim anyways. The water in front of us starts churning.

Two water elemental pop out of the ocean. Jessica tries to talk but gets glared at. We kill them, Elizabeth gets knocked out, we all get to shore. The town is flooded, and a certain noise comes from a ruined building. A female voice cursed. John says hello, and takes a spear to the arm. An Aarakocra flies from the ruin and threatened everyone. It's the same voice. Elizabeth winks, and gets a missed spear.

John offers her a beer, and it is thrown at Elizabeth. They can't hold their liquor. Chris casts Minor Illusion, and the Aarakocra throws a spear at it. They don't know what happened, and their cousin who lives here is dead.

Everyone earns a glare. John tries to go to the market, and is told to get back and is called a pussy (the cat). Chris sneaks by and goes to the market.

Chris and John go to the market. The water we are in is stagnant, about a foot tall. Chris uses Detect Magic and is nearly blinded.

We go to a tower and I tiny hut a long rest. The Aarakocra sensed something and flew off. All the stairs have fallen down. Michael's character poofs into existence. We all tell eachother all the cool stuff in the town.

Chris tries to dispel magic and nothing happens. John scales the wall and gets halfway up, realizing there aren't any footholds left.

My character could've sworn something ducked behind a cloud the second I looked up. Elizabeth gives John 2 javelins out of the 3 she has. The cloud does not seem to look like an illusion.

Elizabeth falls out of the water, the fall scaring away the piranhas. I use minor illusion to seem to look away from the cloud. A small brown winged dot pops out and goes to the other cloud. It's probably the bird lady. Elizabeth swims to the shore.

Chris uses Enhance Ability to give John dexterity advantage, and John uses daggers to climb up. He drops a dagger and Chris mage hands it back.

At the other end of town is a ruined fortress which seems to have been covered with water once, only visible from the tower.

I finally get a response: "Busy right now - get back to you later"

Elizabeth gets bitten by piranhas, but Michael baits them to the ledge with Speak with Animals

Out of the corner of my eye, John and I see a streak of brown feathers. It was the same speck as earlier. Michael distracts the piranhas with rations, and John lightning breaths them. They get fried.

Chris uses Minor Illusion to constantly stare at the feathers. John climbs down. A voice from on top of the tower yells "Hey Short Boy, up here!" It's the bird, who asks what Chris is real. Chris responds with silence.

John stabs the illusion. It disappears. The bird lady swears the castle is haunted and calls John a disbeliever.

The bird asks for a proposal, plays with here sphere a bit, and asks about something in a chest. They ask to buy it. "Name your price." Chris asks how much they have. John readies the crossbow for non-suspicious reasons. John is shooed away.

Chris is given till sundown for the trade and is threatened - "I'll make you ready." Chris goes back to the group and explains what happens, and schemes with us to not give us it. Chris only holds it with a mage hand.

John touches the orb. There seems to be an immense energy in it. Chris Detect Magics on it, and his vision goes blurry, feeling lightheaded. John picks up the orb, and his hand starts to vibrate. John tries to fire it as a bolt, and feels nauseous. The marble-sized orb isn't heavy.

There are large wing beats in the distance. Chris tries to use the orb to move the water and gets dizzy and nauseous. The orb is a magic channeling device. The water and orb had the same effect with a Detect Magic

Chris, John, and I try to channel the orb. We all instantly black out. We wake up in 4 minutes. In the meantime, Elizabeth takes the orb and looks through John's inventory, taking Dalton's silver fork.

The bird approaches and is told Chris died. Threatening Elizabeth, she asks for the orb. Michael has Speak with Dead and the bird lady is convinced to wait for a few minutes. Elizabeth pretends to bring us back to life.

The bird lady refuses to divulge why she needs the orb, and says her cousin is BASICALLY dead. The bird lady lunges her spear at Michael, points her spear and says Orb. Now.

A suggestion spell reveals her cousin was kidnapped and can't say as "He'll kill me. He's going to kill me if I tell you." "He's watching me."

She looks up, holds her head, and demands the orb. I use Message to try and bypass the listening. It was when the city was flooded. This guy did something to the bird, and it was some kind of spell. He can't show his face in daylight and needs to bring them back.

Chris uses Dispel Magic as a film off water appears near her nose and mouth, and she gasps for breath. The person's in the bird lady's head and Chris Sees Invisibility. Nothing. She doubles over - the water is back.

It covers her head. She looks at us, panic stricken, and gasps out "castle". She's dead. It looks like a more powerful version of create water with a long range. Chris tries to dispel magic and his body fills with energy. Temporarily, every last water from the entire city goes "POOF", although in about 3 seconds it's back, taking the fishes with it. He feels nauseous and drops the orb.

We're told if the bad guy gets the orb they win. I tell Rodriguez and get told "Interesting." Michael uses Speak with the Dead. She tells us we kill the guy there and everything is over. The bad guy is tall, stubble beard, brown eyes, brown hair, really tall.

She asks to be buried under a tree. We're told to hide or destroy the orb so he can't use it again. Her cousin's name is Lydia. Michael buries her.

Rodriguez: "Bad, get rid of him right now, don't like him, don't die"

Rodriguez is tall and has short hair. John and Elizabeth try to go to the top of the tower. John shoves Elizabeth off the tower. Chris lightning bolts John. Chris was persuaded into helping.

Alex notices, runs to Elizabeth, and my character runs away (And I leave) as my character isn't taking risks.

# Character Names were introduced now

John - Johnny

Chris - Steven

Me - Syve

Michael - Andy

Jessica - Lyra

We were in the process of attempting to go towards the palace, and have a sort of good route mapped out. John decides we head towards the fortress. My character returns to not ruin plot and stuff.

As we get there, we feel the ground shake a little. The water ripples. We make it to the steps of what seem to be a grand palace that seems to once have been underwater, which seems nearly impossible. I nat 1 perception and get scared by a dead piranha

Both of the front doors have been knocked of hinges, and they aren't found. There's a bunch of tiny holes everywhere, with nothing but water, a mouse, or a piranha. There's a broken-ish fountain in the center of the room.

We all go to the left, and in the corner of the room is a small and suspicious chest, half-hidden. Alissa specifically says "suspicious". I mage hand open the chest. It is locked. Michael has John's thieves tools.

John gets his thieves tools to pick the lock. The earth beneath him rises up with a giant roar. It seems like the breathing underbelly of a giant beast. It seems light blue. Chris uses the orb to lightning bolt it. The room fills with electricity. We're all struck.

The beast starts wailing, somewhat like a song. From behind the whale thing, water starts rushing in. Two hallways leading down are to the left and right. Since Chris is passed out from using the orb, John picks him up. Michael uses Locate Animal to determine it's not an animal. We all go to the left hallway.

Some door slams shut behind us, and some water leaks in through the cracks. It's extremely dark. We faintly hear a call of the beast, just somewhat "there". The passage goes further in. John lights a lantern

John heads forward. The upper world seems flooded. "No turning back now." Michael takes Chris, who wakes up. We find a hexagonal shaped room, and to the right is a passageway. Michael, with a 20, sees the shape of a humanoid figure within the room.

John immediately "Hello sir, how you doing?" earning a "What'd you do, what's happening up there, why are we underwater again? I thought it wasn't time for this again?"

We're asked why we would enter the center room after asking the thing. They ask to see a mark to determine what class it is. He walks to Michael and asks to see their mark. Michael says they don't have one. "What was the procedure I forgot the procedure. Prepare to die!"

They, on the map, are abbreviated "WS". John sneak attack crits with a 29 damage. It hits them in the chest, narrowly missing vital organs, and hits in the stomach. "Dangit! I wasn't trained for this!" They raise their hands. We can see light coming off of their hands.

Two small water like figures form under his hands. Some of the rubble sticks to it creating some kind of armor. They get larger and larger, and they're quite soon two water golems.

Michael hits them and they surrender. The golems disintegrate. They only seem to vaguely know who Czergald is, too terrified to know otherwise. Michael heals them, not wanting to make eye contact. "So what about the guy?" The boss seems to be looking for the orb, and isn't supposed to tell who their boss is, even with a dagger to their throat.

John punches them. The boss is Kabith, and has been looking for the orb to summon or enhance something. They're tall and has long brown hair, but a stubble beard. They say their boss is ruthless. Chris asks if they have an incentive to not destroy the boss.

We tie the guy up, and John ties them over their back. Alissa calls them a "hostage", and John feels slightly bad. They tell us a hallway, etc. is head. There's supposed to be a chamber with Kabith (their boss) in it, and the person is fearful.

"The oracle has been summoned" - Charles. "If you don't treat your fellow humans right something bad will be at the end." His boss will try and drown us. They're capable of remote drowning but only from pulling water from the atmosphere.

We hear a certain noise that might be sorta familiar. It's a sucking/licking noise. It's the blob thing from a failed summoning. Something bites Chris's ankle.

We somehow had the front of the party walk past the first few. They start to explode and acid is in the floor now. The water sorcerer hates these things and starts flipping out.

Shatter, etc. The water sorcerer can't swim. The sorcerer claims to only be able to summon water golems. Around the corner, "Oi! What's that noise! Jonas, is that you?" "Jonas! Oh for Pete's sake, I'll just go there myself!" "Hey Mark? I think the blobs exploded again!" From the distance, "Come on! I worked so hard on those things!"

They look up and notice the hallway was blocked off with a fake wall. A hand phases through. "Hey Mark! Get over here!" John shoots at it. The water sorcerer yells, backs up, and clutches at their chest. "Mark! It's a fake wall! Get that!" They run through with 4 water golems. They flush the acid out with water.

We use the guy as a voice. "Jonas? Jonas, are you okay, buddy?" Jonas replies, "Yea, yea, investigate the water, um. uh. yea. I'm good." Jonas Nat 20'd the acting. Their friends act about the arrow. Mark takes the guy to the ward, and the guy goes "I won't forget this, Jonas!"

The wallway turns left and after that goes right. We ask Jonas what way the boss is. "Probably straight? I've probably been there before". "Which way is the infirmary?" -John, "The guy gave me instructions, I don't know."

John steps in a little goop to turn around the corner. There's a shut door, and it looks metal. John goes towards it. It's metal. Jonas tries to wash the goop away, but it's not that helpful. They collapse.

"Don't open it! Don't open! See the water coming through the cracks? That means it's going to the surface, and the surface means death. Bad, stop, won't happen."

John goes to the main entrance, etc. Michael doesn't heal John. Chris goes to the next hallway. There's another water blob thing coming at us. Chris firebolts it. Hallway is now covered in goo.

The guy knows Summon Golems and Shape Water and Water Bubble, but never learned the summon golems name.

Water bubble - breathe under water. Create/destroy water - duh, and they call themself an idiot for not using create/destroy water to move the goo.

Around the next corner is 2 water sorcerers, and they want to check their rank. "That's nifty, man! Where's your... ?" They take his arm and rips the wrist dagger of. They slam John over their shoulder.

The prisoner tells me about the rank system - Someone puts a mark on someone's hand, and they're the lowest rank. John shouts and reveals our presence. "I got em! You go get the rest!"

Water Sorcerer 2 goes around the bend and summons 2 water golems. The guy coming towards us asks for identification. "Oh, my apologies sir!", as we have all minor illusioned ranks on to us. We try to BS past things, and are told to deal with an intruder (John).

Jonas tries to betray us, but is shut up with mage hand. The golem nat 1s to strike Michael and fails.

Combat. They can grow the golems, and they get bigger.

7 or 8 people show up today. Jessica renames her character to Zoe. Chaos, chaos, chaos.

Golems dead. A random stranger (Sarah) appears and kicks something off a shelf. It falls and breaks open. There's parchment with words in it. It's a plan for a special weapon suited for the body. It looks the right size for John

It seems to look like a modified wrist dagger but modified. John's wrist dagger is missing. I find John's broken wrist dagger. I freeze it. John takes the plan and takes a mental note of what it needs and puts it in his bag. It needs basic stuff but a special but unrecognized object. It seems to be a wrist mechanism with a circle and notches in it.

Jonas seems to not recognize the plan or anything on it, and isn't allowed to recognize. Chris seems to find a paper with the words, "Dear Marianne. I'm hopefully coming home soon. Love you. Johnathan." "I hope you're doing well. Tell the girls I said hello. Remember to feed the dog."

We short rest. There seems to be a few numbers scratched in the corner, so I use my book. I decode it and it says "Testing this out. Try and read it.". We short rest and continue walking. We're in a hexagonal room: Left, or right. We went left. We can go left or right. Jonas tells us we're going to the "big room".

In the big room is a "scary boss guy". I have the orb. I continue to walk forward. We go to another room and go forwards. Chris knocks out Jonas. We almost loose footing to see a pit of water with bubbles rising, hitting the ceiling, and falling back out.

Jonas says "I don't think this is supposed to be here. Can I get down and look?" It's real. Jonas stresses we should turn around. The floor behind us collapses. Jonas says it happened before and was partly their fault. Every huge summon, on fail, the element slowly erodes the world until someone does something.

They're sure Kabith has it under control. The sorcerer that attempted to summon the thing has to remove it with another spell. It has to be the original caster. We all jump over the gap, to the entrance, and go left.

However, we went the OTHER left. Elizabeth goes into a room with a water sorcerer reading a book. They look bored and ask for ID.

Elizabeth winks. Chris adds ID to Elizabeth. The guy thinks Elizabeth's wink is creepy and asks for ID, and flirting isn't allowed on sight. There's a door on the opposite side of the room. The guy notices Chris's minor illusion, but is too tired to care.

They can see through my minor illusion, call it really good, and pass me through with a wink. I telepathically tell them thanks, and they respond in a dark demonic voice.

There's stairs, heading up. In the room, "Identification and bag check." Kabith is just ahead. "Vanishing bag, huh? That's not gonna work on anybody except for me. Get out, you're not going to get past the 2nd dungeon, etc." They have unnaturally sharp teeth.

In the room, it's fairly large with no doors. Two water sorcerers are on either sides of a desk. Behind the desk is Kabith. Without looking they say "stop." Combat. I kill them all with the orb. "Blood" that is blue comes out of Kabith. The goop slowly takes form. A voice comes from it in a language that he doesn't understand yells loudly at Chris and starts to laugh. The ceiling collapses and water pours in. The gel dissolves and we pass out.

We all wake up on top of a flattened castle. The town is gone and water is everywhere. I nat20 a death save and regain 1 HP. Elizabeth died. I take Elizabeth's bag for safekeeping. John celebrates Elizabeth's death.

John puts the orb on Elizabeth's body. Nothing happens. A wyvern appears and causes a carriage stampede. We carriage battle. There's a symbol that Dalton doesn't recognize but calls it "interesting".

Dalton can learn magic through a golden feather only he can use effectively. Rodriguez also took the orb. Elizabeth plays Dalton till she gets revived. My character hears the voice from the demon guy. "So, how are you doing?"

Technically, demonic contracts end at death, and the demon is unemployed as Kaboth is dead. They like a person's existence as a payment, along with searing for existence upon death. I ask if an elf's existence is worth more than a human's due to lifespan, and am told that's a touchy subject.

I'm told it's not possible to offer someone up via suggestion (it'd work for a while but once "they" find out) and after asking about torture that I'm an interesting character. They sigh and say that Kaboth was the only one stupid enough to make a contract to get power and after they made a deal with Czergald they stopped paying the demon.

The only downside is now they're unemployed and have to find some other poor soul. The afterlife isn't something comprehensible by mortals and they won't bother. If someone was revived but made a deal, "paradox", but the demon would technically still own them. They'd be the willing servant of the demon and it's only happened two or three times.

They found the person from walking around in a crypt like an idiot and power seeking people mess with the dead. People'd find a place like the crypt the idiot was wandering around in and sit there till you hear a voice and follow it. The only appear to certain people, though.

The demon-y thing has influence-y powers. Apparently Czergald was hearing a voice, the demon's main nemesis and his brother didn't like it and turned on him.

Apparently the original stopper was closer than I think, and it's not Rodriguez. I start awake in a cold sweat in the middle of the night.

Regarding the demon guy in my campaign. Basically what happened recently is that, since you all met him previously, he came to you in a dream since you are responsible for killing his current "employer" and told you that, in a nutshell,

you can find him in a graveyard if you sit long enough and make a contract with him. He sells his influence and other strange (non combat) abilities at the price of your existence after you die. However, there is this one really annoying other demon that is unfortunately more powerful then he is, and he is upset about that. "How about I cut you a deal?" Also, Czergald has a brother that turned on him. He is also contracted said more powerful demon thing. He decided to tease you with lore.

Chris's character hates Bailey's character and Jeffry is upset that Elizabeth isn't driving him.

We're in the carriage, and Michael drives. We're going to Earvenhale, as Rodriguez sent us there as we got a bottle from there. Chris looks for supplies. There's a stack of rocks with marking on it. "Those interested in darkness" on the left path (there was a split path), only readable by John.

John seems not entirely truthful, and Chris tells us to go Right as John is greedy. John tells us the right is certain darkness. Alissa rules that Thieves Cant isn't a secret code. John is outvoted, and John jumps out of the carriage to go left.

A few minutes later we find eachother again at the exact same crossroad. We all go right and get to the same crossroad. We go left and come to another crossroad with the exact crossroad. We ask to go backwards. Bailey suggests we Platform 9 3/4th it.

John runs left. A few minutes later he comes up behind us. Bailey runs up to the wall, and runs straight towards a cactus. However, after touching it, it vanishes. He was teleported. The entire area is under some sort of illusion spell.

We all go towards the cactus. Jeffry is coaxed forwards. We're all standing in front of the open mouth of a cave. Chris firebolts into the cave. Screeching, shadows on the walls, etc. Chris gets scratched on the face.

Chris nat20 kills it. We go into the cave. He steps down and falls 7 feet to the bottom of the cave. No damage. Bailey is a dwarf. The rest of us climb down. Dalton runs up behind us attempting to carry Elizabeth.

Dalton - "What if this is the place! We need to bring her!" John takes the body. Dalton stays near Elizabeth. John lights his lantern. Jessica falls off of the rock of missing characters.

Chris stays in the back, warning us not to touch him. The floor seems to be slowly sloping downwards. We have to go single file. All of Elizabeth's siblings are dead. John's whole clan is dead. Jessica is a healing bard.

The air gets colder and we come to a sort of crossroads. There are a total of six paths. Dalton doesn't know where to go, and stutters off. He says he picks and chooses randoly.

Bailey charges straight forward. Dalton shrugs and follows. We begin to notice something odd, like a trashcan rolling, coming from directly in front of us. Something seems to be shaking. The cave is not slimy or anything

John shouts as loud as he can, "Hello!" We get a screech back, and 2 beady red eyes. We see a boulder headed right towards us. Not dodgeable.

Chris turns and begins to run. I use Ray of Frost to slow the boulder. We all start running. Bailey tries to anime kick it. The boulder opens its eyes and starts screeching.

I suspect Bailey of cheating due to a +2, +3, +4, +5, +4, and -4 rolls. It's a gouron thingy, with a huge mouth and is screeching. It has pointy teeth. Monsters do not count as animals. Jessica tries to give it a hug.

It attacks Jessica. She takes 20 damage. Jessica drops to 1hp. Jessica gets a candy. It tries to bite Bailey and gets its mouth around Bailey's greataxe. It can no longer bite. Bailey's greataxe is now an axe

Dalton throws forks for combat. The thing has high AC. It dies. We hear a shout, "Hey!" "Hands off my pet!" A tall man in a black man comes down, looks behind us, and notes that it killed Elizabeth and smiles. They ask if we need a service.

They ask how much gold we have. Chris carries Elizabeth and John carries the rock. It's a decorated cave with threads and fibers. We're asked to put Marty on the table. They have a dreamcatcher of sort. They ask who's javelin it is, and we snitch out Bailey. They keep the javelin.

Bailey - "My life." and then backpedals a ton. Dalton defends Elizabeth. They refuse to name a price. Dalton offers his feather, and hands it over. The man says it'll do, partly and asks how much gold we have on us.

They ask for about a thousand gold pieces. We offer them the Wyvern stuff but they have lots of those. They ask for info on an item for lowing the price by about 50 gold. John Nat20s, and he can give us a special deal - info for a 550gold resurrection.

John tells him about the orb, or tries to. Chris shuts him up. The deal requires the location and John and Chris start to pvp, but are shut down.

Rodriguez is pretty short, dark skin, and blond hair. That's the exact opposite - tall, etc., and we reveal where Rodriguez is, at Llam. They found Marty in an egg, and they've been killed about five times.

They're not a wizard. They're a warlock. John attempts to steal hold. We all leave the room after giving the gold. Elizabeth remembers exactly nothing. Most likely permanent. Michael - "I hate you for circumstances you can't even remember". She remembers her name and basic functions of life.

She keeps her abilities, and we welcome Elizabeth back. John celebrates. Bailey tries and claims that Elizabeth's his step-sister. Elizabeth finds out it's false. Dalton keeps flirting with Elizabeth.

I pull Elizabeth and Dalton aside and show them the memories I was there for, but how she died. Elizabeth is shown the birb story and is apologetic. We all go to the carriage.

Alex runs towards Elizabeth, who steps back. Michael uses Speak to Animals to explain the things. Jessica gives me the candy. Elizabeth clings to Dalton and calls Bailey a creep.

We come to a rise in the terrain and see a valley with what looked to be buildings in it. There are some modern-looking buildings in the distance. If we go around we can go across.

We start to go around and hear coyotes a bit closer. Eyes glow in the dark around us.

Bailey uses an ax, and with darkvision the only thing there is glowing eyes. When Bailey retreats they open again. One makes eye contact at Chris after staring. It blinks before Chris and vanishes.

There's two pathes - one across and one down. The moon continues to rise and eyes continue to watch. I recognize the things. They're phantasmal wolves. Not openly harmful until Midnight until they transforn and wreck havoc.

It's a few hours to midnight. Jeffry starts running and the wolves chase. John tries to shoot one. The eyes vanish for a few minutes. We make it into the city, but the guards stop us and order us to halt. The guard is informed we have combat experience. Bailey attacks the damn guard. They yell. We're surrounded.

Chris runs. 20 guards drag Bailey off in chains and he is now in the prison. The initial guard remarks it's good but has happened before. Guards seem on-edge. It's near midnight.

Jessica & Michael look for a pet shop, and Dalton, Elizabeth, and I go for a library. John finds the guy we're supposed to find. Just kidding, a bank for nonsuspicious reason, & Chris looks for a weapons shop.

John goes back on plot, and goes to a town hall. A young girl points him to the... "I don't know, I'm sorry" who asks a different person. And old man with a cane points John towards, at one point, "when he was 16, that buil-"John leaves.

The little girl is 4 and can't read. A shady looking dwarf in a corner has a book. It's waterlogged. They got it from a corpse shed in scales in an alleyway in a city. Titled "Glasses and How to Make Them". It is about drinking glasses.

The old man John was talking to told me about a library that closed down and it was great and rambles about his girlfriends. A pseudo library somewhere round... and is too weak to go anywhere.

The person selling flowers tells John about the town hall in the center of town - it's near a giant stone spire.

It's now midnight. Chris finds a weapon shop with nobody at the counter, and pretends to shoplift. Nobody stops him. Chris looks for magical items. Finds none. He takes a battleax and the lady selling flowers remarks about getting inside. I, Elizabeth, Dalton, etc. get help from the little girl on how to find the inn.

Their dad can apparently do magic. We all go to the inn - the keeper is a half-elf. Michael jumps into a barn to seek shelter. A man looks up and asks why they're here and remarks about the eyes, as it's been normal for a few days. They ask about the huge chasm outside of town and swallowing a party of adventurers

Apparently most of their cows were ripped to pieces the first night. John goes to a room. We pause as we don't want to start combat with 10 minutes left.

Jessica & Michael go poof. There's quite a few bored looking travelers. There's a small bar with 3 types of drinks. Chris rings a bell to summon the loxodon barkeeper. Chris buys a drink, and the barkeeper flips a three-sided coin. Chris is served a molotov cocktail and adds it to his inventory. "Hope you have fire resistance!" The bottle looks about to burst.

Chris drinks it, and pays 5g for it. They remarked about the new customers due to the things. John buys 2 as its their strongest drinks. He only drinks one and saves the other, though. Somehow, they take no damage despite being fucking idiots.

Elizabeth brings Jeffry and Alex into the innkeeper, and a few eerie-looking floating eyes are around. Jeffry is freaking out. It is currently midnight. Alex walks right inside, but Jeffry doesn't, and Elizabeth detaches the carriage.

The loxodon, the only person in the inn as the lady retired for the night, looks at Elizabeth and asks if the pets need water. The loxodon says it might cost money for water as he's not going outside.

Alex doesn't really need water. The loxodon states the rooms are free starting at midnight and John goes to a room (again, as he forgot he did so last session).

The first room has a small dwarf on the bed, who is surprised that nobody locked the door and rushes us. Dalton is looking out the window and looking skiddish, and all the rooms have a window.

Elizabeth grabs Dalton's hand, and he is unable to find why. We find an empty room with an elf in the bed, and they're like the fifth person. They're unhappy as they paid for the room.

John goes to the end of the hallway. "You do plan to sleep with an elf, actually. Dalton is an elf." Elizabeth rolls a 2 for "performance." "I hate you." -Alissa. Elizabeth re-rolls. 1\. "Okay, just stop!"

We go to the last room. There's a meowing, but John sees a pointy hat on the wardrobe. John opens the wardrobe. Chris lays down on the bed. Elizabeth grabs the hat and is attacked by a cat. The cat has beady yellow eyes.

Elizabeth names it Casper and John pets it (fails). The cat darts under the bed. The cat is named Casper, and it sniffs Elizabeth's hand. Elizabeth gives the cat the hat, and it is in the hat. Two seconds later, there's a human in the hat and there's a female human in it. "Nobody steals my hat and lives. Four, what are you doing in my room?"

"Bye Ms. Casper. We get a door slammed in our face." The witch looks at us and slams the door on John. "Bye Ms. Casper!" You hear a groaning. We find a seemingly empty room.

We give Elizabeth and Dalton the bedroom. Chris tries to take it first. "Do you want this to be canon?" "I guess it's canon." "You guys find another room and sleep on the floor."

Skip towards morning. Long rest. LONG REST. "I hate you all..." "I'm never gonna let you live this down..." "Half dwarf-half-elf..." "Is it 9 months or later?"

Skip towards morning. There's a not very familiar character in the lobby. A tabby tabaxi in iron boots and gloves is sitting there, sitting in front of the (unneeded fire), and she turns around and asks who we are.

Chris asks where she got the armor and she made it herself with help from a dwarf. She asks where we came from. Chris gives a non-answer, and thinks Elizabeth looks familiar. The cat is not a jasper. "It's nice to meet you, Ms. Jasper." Chris explains the amnesia.

Their name is Lyla. There's a fairly large issue earlier last night. Jeffry is in the corner of the in eating hay that the Loxodon is feeding him. Elizabeth has no reaction to that. Alex wants to leave. Chris lets him out, or tries to as the carriage is directly outside.

Chris "yeets the door open". The carriage slams into a pedestrian, while Elizabeth goes through the (closed) window, and the tabaxi opens it. "I prefer windows to doors as well."

In Earvenhale, everything is made out of stones. Chris tries to do something in retrospect, trying to "last night" twist his magic rod around his battleax, but is told to do it in real time. And this is why we need an artificer.

My character hasn't seen any places of death but sees shops selling jewels and stuff. There's another loxodon, a brownish color with rough skin, "We're just gonna say there's a really high family that had lots of kids and they hid" after my "Aren't elves supposed to be rare"? The loxodon asks if my character has a significant other.

They're hand mined in the mines, from 50-150 gold and they're not that cheap. I wander around town and see a surplus of strange snake people. Yuan-ti. There's been a quite lot of them, and they seem to all be half-breed humanoids.

John fails to find the bad part of town, and my character finds a black cat from earlier last night, and she's sitting on a clay building shaped like a dome. The building seems to be... a dome shaped clay building.

John tries to find the evil part of town and when nobody is looking he is knocked out. He is pulled into the darkness. Me, in the clay building, sees the cat watch me enter and vanish. There's a mix of every possible race you could imagine. They're standing around a bunch of different booths with strange items.

There's an aarakocra with colorful plumage and feathered earrings and a chain around the top of her beak - seems decorative. They have many types of jewelry. They don't have set prices and like to barter.

For something modest and subtle, a bracelet would be... We're not good in subtlety... We're looking at a 60g for a necklace, 10g for a bracelet, and 15g for a chain bracelet. My looks for more magic stuff.

Elizabeth, Chris, and John get back and out of character we (Alissa, Vanessa, and I) overhear them talking about performance rolls. I hold back the sentence, "So that's why getting food took so long!" The pedestrian we ran into says its the 2nd strangest thing that's happened all day. Chris goes to the gem store.

Elizabeth puts Jeffrey on the carriage. Chris uses Detect Magic, and one area stands out. It's the booth a human is running. They seem to be a half-elf-ish, and Chris goes to the booth. They ask about out of the ordinary stuff. He comes back with a small stone that looks turquoise with brown lines in it that shimmer a little bit. It's very magical but he has no idea what it does. Chris buys it for 50g.

I look for more magical stuff that's not jewelry. Chris casts Mage Hand using the rock. It kinda floats there.

Elizabeth sees a person on a stretcher being carried by a woman and a man, running towards the inn. They hear something about "lucky" and "pulled him out." Elizabeth and Dalton turn around and see what happen.

My character asks if there's any wizards around, and the pedestrian doesn't know. There's mainly just miners there. The tabaxi is still in the inn and informs Elizabeth that someone's pulled out of the chasm north of the town.

Elizabeth, unfamiliar with the circumstances since we haven't seen the chasm, there were 6 travellers. 2 came back alive. The ground opened up underneath them and there's a two-mile wide trench north of the town.

She looks Elizabeth dead in the eye. "It's almost worth a look, isn't it?" and winks. Animals can't go into the chasm. Chris finds me. I don't waste a 3rd level spell on contacting Rodriguez about it. John wakes up in a dark room that smells of Earth. He is gagged and tied up.

"You're about to be inducted into the cult of the chasm." "You're actually not that far off." My character tries to find a graveyard. A robed figure walks up to John, who watch. He seems tall and attempts to make eye contact.

He looks at John and smiles, and John gives him a death glare. They know about the party's dislike based on what happened at the water temple and that Kaboth is dead. John is forced to send a message to the party, by having a message carved into his hand. It's a distorted peace sign.

It doesn't look like it'll fix itself. The knife is coated in John's blood, and John is told to tell us to stay away "or else we'll meat a grizzly fate".

John - Tries to talk himself into more pain. Masochist. "You and everyone you love will die." John lightning breaths. Fails. The gag gets electrified and John can mumble. Someone knocks John out again. He wakes up on the street.

We all meet up and exchange info. Chris tells us to avoid tabaxi. The tabaxi from the inn walks up. She doesn't notice John's hand. "So what are you all up to today?". We fill the tabaxi in, and she doesn't recognize it.

She seems to be sly-looking. (2% battery). My character asks why Elizabeth seemed familiar to the tabaxi. Elizabeth trusts the tabaxi, who doesn't know where they recognize Elizabeth from. 100% lying. They seem to think, and asked if we've been in a cave recently.

She was going spelunking, looking for gems with magical properties, and Chris realizes he got scammed. Chris goes to find the merchant. Chris, after rolling like 5 times, finds where the vendor used to be. Everything is gone.

There is no alleyway that Chris can see, and Chris goes behind the curtain and finds a dead snake. My character believes the tabaxi unconditionally due to a 1\. It was at most a few hours work and someone that looked like Elizabeth was slung under someone else's shoulder.

John, like an idiot, fills everyone in. She knows about the necromancer. Chris polymorphs into a dog, wasting a 4th level spell slot (his only). He picks up a scent (of the person) and tracks it. Chris finds them with a sack on their back.

Without polymorphing back, Chris tries to kill them. 1d4 of damage, and the person's throat is slit. Chris loots the body and gets his 50g back, along with 20g extra. That's gotta be cursed, right? Chris is Chaotic Something.

It's apparently a character trait of theirs. Still a dog, Chris gives John the rocks. Chris asks if that works on anyone, and Chris doesn't know. I try and find the little girl's father... wait... I try and make myself heard, but am ignored. One person from the party of 6 is in critical condition.

Chris threatens to kill anyone that scams him and states that he has insane tracking capabilities (for a sorcerer). We go to the sorcerer. Chris has John wrap his magical rod around his greatax.

The rod snaps in half due to a natural 1\. John used his cursed dice. What a shock. We're at the chasm, and it's a huge split in a flat land. A few miles north we can see the ocean with a rocky beach.

Out of character, I think there's an orb in the ancient village. Dalton wants to stay up at the top. Dalton seems unsure to weather we'll be back, and says he'll handle anyone suspicious. John winks at Dalton.

Elizabeth immediately gets jealous, and Dalton says he'll snipe anyone suspicious with knives and knock them with knives. Dalton stays a little bit back (a nearby hill, 1/4th a mile) as the chasm could open further.

We also remind Dalton to stay in the carriage after midnight and to let Alex into the carriage after Midnight, or at night to go back to the town (or if at any point he feels unsafe) "You just tried to do it with him and now you're trying to take care of him."

Dalton remembers he has forks. Before leaving, he gives Elizabeth a hug. Jessica's character is dropped in by the Rock of Absent Characters. The chasm looks extremely dry. John's the first to notice there's two halves of a cactus - one half on one side, and the other on another half.

There's nothing my character can see that could cause such gashes. Bailey tries to join as his "trap" character, and falls flat on his face for 4 damage. There are 4 dungeons and 1 final boss. There seems to be no easy way down (a sort of-ish). The carve into the cactus seems to have not affected the ground.

We see some body parts underneath some rocks. John tries to use his daggers to get down. We all climb down, except for Syve, who slips. It seems that we got to where the party of 6 were caught. It looks like they fell. "I loot their bodies" - John & Jessica, "Are they okay?", etc.

It seems their bodies have already been looted. Bailey tries to seduce Chris, but doesn't even roll. There's a whispering that seems to be getting closer. It's the devil guy. Bailey tries to seduce. Everything around us turns black.

We're in a dark void, facing the man we saw in the dungeon. This time their hair is blood-red with sharp teeth and yellow eyes. Unfortunately we can't offer the adventurer's souls. John asks if they can posses, but only if they allow them to. Their body would still age, though. All we'd need to do is find and kill their enemy (who is immortal - eternal youth thing), who is almost exactly the same, helping eachother. We can get spammable teleportation (towards purpose), info, etc.

However, they can't use their powers too much in our favor too much or else their enemy will figure out. John and I accept the deal, and we feel ourselves change in a way. We can't pinpoint it. Besides them being a demon, nothing is suspicious. However, their power of influence is a different deal involving souls.

The demon states that only given enough leeway they can take unwilling souls. The discount deal - we help kill eachother's enemies, or we do the soul deal. John tries to do a private conversation, but is generally ignored.

The demon assures us that soul deals are worth it, but the two deals are mutually exclusive. Chris does the soul deal. The demon wasn't expecting it at all. No takebacks. The demon can't give immortality, and Chris feels empty all of a sudden. High magic users are able to notice the deal, and it won't exactly be an issue.

The demon can't influence afterlives until dealing, and that soul deals are a no for everyone but Chris as he can only handle so many souls. Elizabeth doesn't take the /tp deal. John wanted to do the soul deal but is too late.

Bailey also wanted the soul deal on "Spend eternity in your bedroom". Chris's charisma is essentially always 20, so... The demon notes that the deal is dangerous but... Elizabeth takes the deal, and is told "I'm fairly sure you used to like me." because she winked at the demon before.

John & Elizabeth suggest derailing the campaign and starting a bank. John pays Jessica 10g to make the deal. The demon sees the rest of us all later, and the demon will be with Chris always. Chris is a Charisma caster.

Skip a week. Failed one shot.... hell, let's write about that

Party is assassins to kill a visiting king at a party. Chris is part of a church. The party spends 30 minutes looting a shop. Chris + Elizabeth go to the church and Elizabeth gets church clothes. Chris does confessions, and the party follows a palace guard out of the church.

John kills the guard and wildshapes into a tiger and eats their body. There goes the party's easy way into the king's event. They decide to sneak into the event anyways (even though the king would have been exposed at other events), except for Chris who camps at a window.

The party decides to not get ay disguises for Michael and John, and pass them off as part of the church. They get pulled aside and asked about their commoner appearance.

I make everyone do an intellegence throw and I tell Elizabeth (with a Nat 20) that there are less guards than normal, and far less for a visiting king (even though there were 40). Elizabeth tries to poison the king. The king isn't stupid and one of their servants forces Elizabeth to drink first. It's a slow-acting poison, though, so Elizabeth is fine.

Michael and John start a fight. Chris tries to snipe the king, but the king's invisible bard stops that with a Shield spell. Fight, mass suggestion + Cutting Words, Chris flees. Everyone else is arrested. Elizabeth dies in the morning to poison, as does the King, but the King is revived.

Everyone else is sentenced to death when the bard says "Now, confess under my Zone of Truth!", casting Suggestion instead of Zone of Truth.

Good god. That was a disaster. Including the fact that John & Chris were in Minecraft for 90% of the time and forcing me to deal with them ingame too. Not to mention all the skipped plot.

The king was visiting for the political marriage of his daughter, who is in the marriage quite unwillingly (Geas spell). The daughter would be a helpful NPC. The king's invisible guard is a half-elf Bard (Level 11), who has been the King's lifelong friend. The King isn't actually that bad of a person, but has had to make some quite dividing divisions.

The Bard is more lawful good, looking up to the king. The visiting King, a chaotic good would rather not force his daughter into a marriage, but doesn't see any other choice to avoid invasion.

An intentionally skipped D&D weekend goes here. The prepared excuse I had for not going was that I had other things I needed to do, which was technically true. They just didn't have to be done during the weekend. Nobody asked, though. Apparently they didn't do that much D&D.

The tabaxi fighter earlier was one of the evil guys. My character poofs into existence as having 2 people go through a dungeon won't work. Party finds an opening in roof, goes into roof, etc. Chris used his charm to get ahead and try and solo a boss. Somehow, he almost wins.

The boss ran. The giant Wyrm is no longer listening to the boss. The building around us slowly starts to collapse.

As the building collapses we escape into a dark cave. I see there's, from one tunnel, is the smell of water. From the other two is a slight breeze. At the top of the tunnel is a figure. It seems to have a large sword.

They take a few steps forward and is trying to block us. It looks very much like the cat lady. She tells us, "Your little... friend... and I had a bit of a fight and I would have killed him if it weren't for that bird..."

Lila, the tabaxi, charges us. 2 chromatic orbs later and she is dead. We level up to level 10\. Dalton doesn't question the big birds. We meet back at the carriage and explain we killed the sketchy Tabaxi. Dalton is disgusted by the head.

Alex is not a fan of the head. We go back the village and clean ourselves off beforehand. Last night, Dalton was wandering around and heard some rumors. The ruins on the way here were rumored to be the origin of the wolves. The flower lady mentioned it.

The loxodon indoors states that the flower lady went out and saw the things from the ruins, which are rumored to be cursed. John hears a whisper from the demon. "You don't have a week, maybe a few days."

John doesn't sleep. The loxodon on the main floor is asleep. About an hour or so to Midnight, John goes to the marketplace for anywhere that looks like it's rich. He breaks into McCob's Jewelry.

From the corner of his eye, John sees the floating eyes. It's about half an hour till midnight. He picks the lock and sees nobody. John steals some necklaces, or tries to. He steals 3 necklaces and sneaks out.

He finds a "walking stick with gems", that is alive and slowly breathing. It has a snake's head. It tries to bite John and then runs. John leaves the room, and it's 5 minutes till Midnight.

My character uses Scrying. The eyes are closer to John, and he attempts to climb on the roof and "Assasins Creed" style run back. However, on the way back, he realizes he'll have to run across ground because he can't make the jump from the roof to the hotel. John goes around the back (making sure nobody sees). It is midnight and John hears a lot of howling, but not on the wolves.

He looks down and a massive creature manifests, from the floating eyes. Golden fur, stands on 2 legs. It looks at John and howls. The rest do the same. They aren't inclined to jump at the building.

John takes some notes. They look like golden werewolves with red eyes that seem to glow. There's quite the following on the building. To jump inside, it'd be really hard or he could take the long way.

I wonder to myself if John was able to lock the hotel from the outside, while the hoard moves with John (even though they can't see him). The wolves start clawing at the walls of the hotel. John tries to find a way into the inn from the roof.

My character goes to the main floor, and the loxodon is collapsed behind his counter. There is no fire in the fireplace, so the chimney would not burn John. I do not catch the logs on fire by sending sparks up and showing John the chimney.

John is a white dragonborn covered in white ash. We pass the night. John cleans himself off. I, using magic, clean myself off. Dalton wakes up and asks if we had a long night.

Dalton's heard of the things before - not widely known, no one source of info. They're extremely dangerous in their physical form and harmless in spiritual. They have some tie to the moon but that's it. A werewolf but worse.

My character's book has a small section - Kinda a loose cannon and they never do what you say. You're better off just not summoning them. The book has a page on "un-summoning". tl;dr if a person summons something, destroy the person or the item used in the summoning. If it's been around it's probably an item.

John finds a map shop. A short looking dwarf is behind a counter. We're in the upper continent, which is nearly empty. John trades his shield for the Upper map, and 10g for the lower one.

Literally everyone denies they have something magical. The flower girl goes up to us and has heard of something magical - a flower patch. She swears there's some bug up there that glows at night.

She's been up at night but the wolves seem to leave her alone. It's right outside of town and up a hill.

... Skip to Air Dungeon. The Journal has details.

The Demon teleported everyone next to John. Syve shows up. A hoard of Griffins show up and only notice John. Elizabeth animal tames them. It hovers over her. It seems to have webbed talons. The Griffin is female. Elizabeth calls it Zodiac

Chris polymorphs into a Griffin and flies Elizabeth up, but doesn't polymorph into one with webbed feet. Anything ornamental is gold. Chris has the Demon make John no longer interested in Gold. No save, no nothing. Chris brings us all up.

The palace is made of pure white marble. John is no longer interested in any riches or shiny things via the demon until further notice.

In Combat, one of the sorcerers gazes at Jessica. We tie out the one that's a coward and tie them up.

Also, my character got KOd with 48 damage to to the face. The only spell that did damage in combat was Fire Bolt. I'm a tad bit salty. Also, most magic is casted verbally (Disregarding nonverbal components).

Plan: Boss, Prep, Exploring, Final Dungeon. 5 more sessions.

It reminds us of when I found the paper with the beasts - the whale, wyrm, and dragon being others. It looks familiar because of it. John opens the door and gets struck by lightning. Elizabeth laughs.

Elizabeth flirts a Sorc out of the battle, and flits the encounter over. Chris reverts the curse and we go to the Treasury. I get 40g, Jessica gets 120g. John finds a baby dragon. Chris gets rubies, etc. The dragon likes to eat fire beetles.

John gives his owl to Chris. The baby dragon is a boy. We name them Gilmore. We kill the final boss and polymorph the Manticore into a cat. Threw off edge. As the castle falls we land on a 3 headed eagle.

Jessica falls off. One of the heads catches Jessica. It takes us back to the start of the campaign - a blackened area. It shakes us off and leaves. We're att what used to ge Jing-Yow. Gilbert recognizes it as dragon ash.

I look around and see a man standing in the clearing - Rodriguez. He looks shocked, and wonders what we were doing. Rodriguez remarks that John is chaotic evil and is suspicious of the dragon.

Rodriguez sent Mary to the march to tell us to go to JingYow. I determine it's a lie as he went from JingYow & Llam in one day.

Everything Rodriguez is wearing is magic, including a book and a casting stone. Rodriguez cast teleport to get there - multiple times. He requests we follow him. He leads us to Jeffrey and Alex with the carriage. He sends us to the Broken Capitol.

Apparently, he's been hiding a lot and he couldn't bring himself to "him" to put him out of his misery. He admits to being a coward. He's apparently too old for this. He levels up by 7 levels. It'll last for a few days.

We're told to protect the Llama. We long rest. He's Abolith. I ask why Czergald hasn't left the capital and Rodriguez is silent. Rodriguez can "feel" that Czergald hasn't moved. They have a connection. They're brothers.

Rodriguez stole Czergald's work and left. Steven wishes to get 2 levels (to 20) and passes out. Rodriguez tells us that is the kind of power that overtook Czergald. We go back.

We resurrect Chris (Now the demon). Chris will take orders if he's brought back. I Simulacrum. We're teleported to the back of a crumbling palace. We fight some wyrmlings, fire sorcerers, loot a few apples (John takes a bite of the yellow one), some gold, bypass a few puzzles, etc. Chris eats the Red Apple. It's a bit sweet.

John takes a bite of the green apple. It's very sour. John eats a cockroach. He's healed by Jessica. We find a skeleton with a piece of paper that reads "FEED OUTLIER". Jessica resurrects them. It's an elf female, completely naked.

John slaps her awake. Chris gives her his cloak. She knows how to fight and was dead for 50 years. She uses longbows normally. Her name is Mika. She remarks that eating the apples was probably a terrible idea.

She tries to eat the green apple and spits it out. She bites the yellow apple. The middle door opens, and the wall crumbles to dust revealing a passage. She devours the entirety of the sweet apple.

Mika screams "Dragon" and runs. John shouts, "That's Racist". Clone dies. The dragon dies.
