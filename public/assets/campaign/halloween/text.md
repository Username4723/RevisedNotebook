Party is in a forest with trees, going to an area looking for easy jobs

We are following a path along a river. The moon is not full (and not spooky)

A parrington dives towards the party due to John being far too noisy (interrupting DM), which are circling above John's head, which block out the almost-full moon.

Elizabeth prays to the DM (rolls tons of dice) to forgive sins (and target John) and the parringtons all turn their attention to John.

John tries to shoot one with a dart in the wing, which misses, and tries to hide, drawing attention.

John and Elizabeth run. The perytons decide to fly away because the DM thinks this is insane.

We make our way to Red Larch, a small town that carEvens and travelers go through every day. It's quite populous, except most of the population is traveling

Red Larch does not have a mayor, buy a constable. It's a bout a week from Waterdeep & Neverwinter (big towns). The town breaths live in, and inns cater to travelers.

Minor issues are nothing unusual, from bandits to sEvege humans. Six months ago, a bigger threat has moved in. It is unknown and there is a bad air.

There are people meandering around, and similar. Elizabeth decides to go to a tavern. Someone selling roses looks up and redirects the town to the Helm at Highsun (Interesting), to look for information, and notes really strange things have started to happen.

She mentions a young lady named Pel that hasn't happened since the Spook happens when she saw a ghost. Everyone decides to go to a tavern. The taproom is large and dimly lit, with locals conversing around. It's not a good place for fine dining.

Charles goes to the "center" of the town to find a guard to ask where the constable lives, and tosses a copper piece to a child drawing in the sand with a stick, opting to follow the child.

Elizabeth goes to the bartender (tall & grizzly with a subtle beard), and asks Elizabeth for her order. Elizabeth asks for a shot, and asks about anything suspicious. The bartender mentions about the rumors, and says "Time to gossip" (favorite part of the job).

The other day, 3 children (last name starts with a T). Their father came in (mother head of clothing shop) for a drink and mentioned a spook with dwarves. They were out of town (a few mines) picking berries and a dwarf comes around and tells them to stay away from the location (Lance Rock) because there's "plague there". John rolls to determine if he's lying, and can't tell (3).

Charles follows the running child down the street, who turns and jumps into a house that seems like a clothing house. Charles knocks on the front door and enters. A middle-aged lady stands at the lady, who asks if he saw his little boy (named Johnny).

Johnny runs in through the back door, saying they "definitely weren't picking berries", who is sent to his room. Charles asks about the plague, and the woman thinks its a rumor. The woman doesn't know the location, but mentions Johnny might know.

Charles metagamed and shouldn't know about the plague, so his god told him since he's a paladin.

The bartender doesn't know if something happens to the kids, who sent home. Another different story: A lady called Minnie (Mandivern), and her granddaughter went off toward an old tomb which is supposedly haunted, and Pel (the granddaughter) apparently saw a ghost.

The bartender states that they'll tell them rumors if they buy a drink (5g). Apparently Constable Harbor had a theory for a while that there were bandits near Carin Road. Vanessa steals a half bottle of bear from a drunk guy.

Eve falls asleep in the corner of a tavern. Charles goes to Johnny's room, and tosses some copper on the floor. Johnny's two sisters go for it, and Charles asks about where the rock is, who replies it's a few miles west of town, and it's super tall and very visible. West is Kheldell Path.

Charles meets everyone at the tavern and fills everyone in. Everyone heads out to the path, with Charles carrying Eve out (earning strange looks).

Elizabeth (& co) walk around the Kheldell Path till what she sees what she assumes is the Lance Rock. John looks for anything suspicious (nat 20). A few hundred feet south of the path is a ravine, with a path and a sign that mentions "Come no closer or else you catch the plague of the Lord of Lance Rock." Vanessa vandalizes the sign, writing "uno reverse card". Eve does the same, writing "no u"

Charles enters the cave with a religious book. Elizabeth investigates the stone, but sees nothing. Everyone enters the cave, with the walking order being Charles (brandishing a priest book), Eve in the back, everyone else in the middle. Eve fell back into a coma, carried by Elizabeth. John still has a limp.

The cave opens into darkness from which a breeze brows, carrying the odor of death. The passage narrows as it proceeds.

John loots a body 60 feet into the cave, and it's a zombie. It picks up a club and hits John for 5 damage. Charles deals 10 damage to the zombie.

I cast Turn Undead, and the zombie runs away. Dianne tries to use a longbow to shoot it, and barely hits, doing 8 damage. Vanessa tries to poison spray, which it is immune to.

The zombie dies. The cave opens up. There's a boulder in the middle with dark stains over its top, and the cave has 2 exits. Elizabeth looks around to see for anything. There's nothing too suspicious.

A large wooden box full of rocks drops down on Charles and Dianne, who roll 4s and 1s to dodge. They take 2d6 damage.

John throws the box back up, and 2 zombies fall out. After the zombies die, Part of the party sneaks into the left enterence, about 10 feet high. Spurs are coated in dry blood. Vanessa investigates, and the blood seems recent. There are some figures dancing around in the cavern.

John and Dianne sneak back to the rest of the party, and Vanessa joins them in sneaking into the tunnel on the right. There are motionless people propped against the walls. John picks up a shortsword, and Vanessa finds out the bodies are twitching a little.

John attacks, and a skeleton sits up and attacks back. 2 more skeletons enter. John runs, getting no exp. ... Everyone is in the room, with 2 skeletons.

The two skeletons die to Charles. John goes to the other room and touches the rock. It is a rock. Vanessa wants to tie John's mouth shut. Alissa: "I'll allow it." Vanessa succeeds. John breaks out. We enter the other room. All 3 zombies are dressed up in costumes. John attempts to intimidate them to go away (fails).

The 3 zombies die. Charles heals John. They walk into a room. There are 2 iron chests. John and Charles in the front dodge falling rocks from the ceiling. There's a voice from the ceiling, "You dare to pit yourself against the lord of Lance Rock? Death is your reward!" I don't notice they're mimics. Neither of the chests have anything inside. The voice is coming from a peephole in the rock above us. Charles hits the wall, which cracks and shutters. Elizabeth, Charles, and I back up. The peephole and ceiling fall down. A human figure is walking in the passage behind us, with 4 skeletons. The skeleton attacks, and human flees

After the skeletons die, John transforms into a werewolf and escapes the rocks. The DM is angered by a flying plastic ball. The cave rumbles, and an ankheg falls from the ceiling. Eve and I roll an 8 or 18 and are free, everyone else takes damage.

John and Dianne get into a fight, and DM rules that back to town Dianne can do whatever she wants to John. Everyone goes to the Necromancer, and finds a pedestal made of arms, on which a dark rune sits. There's a movement in the curtains in the back of the room.

Dianne sneaks by the necromancer and tries to steal the sigil. The man notices, steps out, and screams, "Can't you see it? It's the eye!", taking out a wand.

John tries to steal Dianne (unconscious)'s dagger, and fails. I take the dagger when casting Spare the Dying. Looting: Charles gets the orb (drift globe), and John takes the Magic Missile wand. Behind the curtain is 78 gp and 4 polished jet gems (worth 50 gp each), which go to Elizabeth.

We get 50 gold pieces to split, while Dianne is healed in the inn. We all go to the market (except John, who snuck away). John sells the gems. The merchant gives Dianne and I silver daggers (6 total) after finding out John is a werewolf.

The DM stated that the Campaign was derailed, and will end when the rest of the party kills John
