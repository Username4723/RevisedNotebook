Everything south of Waterdeep is conquered by orcs which have banded together under an unknown leader. "World Map - Too Large: <https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/dnd/resources/Sword-Coast-Map_HighRes.jpg>" Mirabar and Waterdeep are rumored to be the last big cities left. In Mirabar, there is a forge with great magics, with the Fire of Dragonborns, etc. It is rumored that there are hundreds of ships that are made to travel to a new world. Nobody has seen ones.

There are 150 refugees to start with, which we are escorting. The leader of the group is an Elf named Aaradon, who died to orcs. We are at the steps of Waterdeep with 50 refugees, at the southern gate, going to the southern ward.

We walk there and see two guards. Alissa asks for entry, and the guards ask if there are orcs. They see none, but seem very anxious. The guards step aside and let us through. Alissa tells them not to die.

John states that everything is in character unless said otherwise.

There are thousands of wrecked buildings, with some intact. There are hundreds of tents along the roads.

Eve tries to join the 17 charisma squad (Dianne, Alissa, Vanessa, Me), but only has 16 and is rejected. It is revealed that everyone has only a day of rations.

Eve's character is accepted to the 17 charisma squad as a trainee. Loud church bells ring, coming from a guard tower. Some guy, looking like a general, states everyone is leaving in one hour. Alissa asks where, and they are heading to Mirabar.

The group is accepting refugees from everywhere. Alissa suggests going in waves, but is shot down. Alissa then suggests a scouting party, but fails. The market's stuff is half off. The charisma squad goes off and finds it.

We go to the market and see what remains of an inn (called the "Dripping Dagger"). There's someone with a goldfish who is selling weapons. Jason tries to buy the goldfish, but gets a dagger pulled on him.

Alissa looks for interesting things. To the left is a girl, who looks very familiar, who looks sad and anxious. They are an elf. My character cannot place them.

Alissa looks for animals, and gets a second 3\. She sees a second goldfish. Vanessa tries to persuade the person to sell the goldfish, which fails. Eve succeds, but the person asks for 200g. We buy the fish for Eve and Vanessa's gold, but has no container. Vanessa tries to steal the container, but doesn't get away with it. Eve runs. The person yells, but nothing happens.

Dianne sees a blacksmith, with an elf at the forge, making a double bladed scimitar, and goes to get stealthy. Jason goes to the inn. Half of all the people are guards, and three seem to be drunk. Jason sees no frying pan. I'm still with Alissa. Alissa looks for a mount and remembers a guy talking about a stable, but doesn't know where it is. Roll perception, nat 1.

Vanessa joins Alissa and I, and we now know we have a fish. I realize I have a world map. Dianne finds a shelf and a set of keys.

Dianne steals the keys with a 24, and there's a string coming off of them. Jason goes to the bartender and asks for beverages, who only has water as he's about to close up. Everyone has a full waterskin. Jason buys a 5 gallon bottle of water for 20g. Jason asks about the mysterious girl, but doesn't get much info. Jason reveals she looks familiar, and the bartender demands 5g for the info. Jason goes to the girl in the corner.

Out of nowhere, a guy is talking about maps. I learn the whole city is evacuating in an hour. Most have already evaculated. I buy a map of here for 1g. Alissa finds the stable on the map, and we all go there. "Waterdeep: <https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f7/ce/96/f7ce96199fa326958aaf521365e2e505.jpg>" The string on the keys appears to just be a string. Dianne cuts the string with a dagger. On the key seems to be a thieves code. It's a symbol telling rogues to go to a location. She goes to the ruins of an old building, and goes in.

Jason says hello to the girl in elvish, who responds hi back. The girl asks if Jason if she has seen her dad, who's named Aaradon (guy who died). Jason reveals he travelled with him, and they parted ways. The elf can tell Jason is... misleading. The girl asks what happens, and the girl has 5 daggers. Jason reveals the shortsword and says "He fought bravely."

She loos like she starts tearing up and leaves. The 17 charisma squad (minus Dianne) goes to the stable. It looks like a military stable with 30 horses and some donkeys. Most have heavy armor, like warhorses. There's a guy taking care of them. There are 2 guards.

Alissa goes to the guy who seems surprised. They look like a dwarf. At a side stable, there's a few horses and donkeys. They look extremely healthy. They're all brown, but one has black spots. Alissa asks where they got the spotted one, and finds out it's a pony.

The donky's 50g, horses 75, and pony 30g. We get a discount if the animal likes us.

There are 2 brown, 2 black, and 1 white horse. Vanessa feeds it. The horse likes Vanessa. The horse is white and looks like it has a strange glow. It costs 90g since it's special. The cost is split between Vanessa and Eve.

Dianne sees 3 symbols on the door, and knows that they are 2 infamous criminal guild signs. Dianne goes in. There's nothing there, but remains of a bed, etc., a closet, remains of a kitchen. In the closet is stairs.

The bottom step is triggered to make a stone wall fall down behind them. There are 5 guys with longbows pointed at her face, and Dianne screams "Hi!", and when asked how found, "You kinda left symbols EVERYWHERE", and is asked to prove she is a rogue. She translates a message from Theives Cant as proof. Someone goes to her left, pulls out a lantern, and puts it down.

There is a meeting table of about 25 people there. They are arguing about prices.

Jason tries to get the 3 drunken guys to do an Irish drunk song, and gets a natural 20\. They sing and dance. Jason goes upstairs.

Alissa tries to find the worst one and is jokingly pointed to a grave. They look good, but bad in comparason. Alissa gets her hand bitten, for 3 damage. Alissa tries to buy the second worst, and tames it, and buys it for 50g.

Dianne browses items and sees a person sneaking around, and goes and talks to him. He vanishes. Dianne finds a secret thing.

Jason hears a crying person upstairs in the inn, behind a locked door. Jason knocks. The person stops crying. Nothing happens... continues... Jason knocks again, is told to go away, and then knocks again. Jason sees a dagger going through the door, that almost hits him, and knocks again. The door opens and Jason is failed to stab. Jason asks for help getting the refugees, and is told she will help him later.

Alissa names her donkey Ebonizer. Vanessa rides her horse and gets lost. She gets back to the party. The Cha Squad heads back to the refugee squad. Dianne's conferrer shows her all sorts of cool items. She buys wrist daggers for 50g, and puts them on her wist and tests them. They work. She buys a sleep potion for 10g.

We hear the church bell ringing again. Everyone starts to pack up, and soldiers go to the walls. They pull back their bows. The bell tower goes KABOOM! Everyone starts panicing. There are more fires at the other side of town. Alissa tries and to gather everyone, and the guards are busy at the main gate. Orcs are breaking through - a full legion of them. Alissa takes the back to guard. On the main road are 10 orcs.

Jason sees orcs readying. I kill them off with Shatter, and Jason puts them in a fog. The fog is dispersed because of the wind. An orc warchief steps out of the shadows, and is very angry. Alissa threatens them.

Alissa and Vanessa "pee their pants" due to the Orc Chief's growl. Vanessa uses an illusion of Alissa to distract the Orc Chief. It runs. Elizabeth drops out of the sky or joins the party somehow.

We go towards the Sword Mountains. The city is burnt, destroyed, and there are cries from people in the city. Some people left family behind. Everyone who left behind dead.

Jason sees the one elf girl somewhere in the crowd of refugees we managed to rescue. There are around 270 refugees left. Once we get to Mirabar, there is a giant stone wall (100 ft tall, 3 ft thick) exists. There's one gate, the main gate, with ten guards. They look familiar. Alissa asks if they are warforge. They open the gates. There are several metal machines that look like arrowheads. They are rocketships.

They all look deserted, not active. Someone wants to see the party. We all follow the warforge page, and we are taken into a central castle. There are "weird machines" everywhere. They look like models of the things outside.

The person that looks like a leader asks if we are warriors. We are told Hamlet Hook, the person that made the rockets, has been captured by orcs, and that he is the only person that knows how to start the rockets. He a string of clues. We need three keys to start the rocket, and we only know where one is. We're supposed to go across the entire map on a treasure hunt. Bad move by the NPC that originally made the thing, because now there are 3 seperate places that can be compromised and fuck the entire plan up instead of one, and somehow the one person would have been able to bypass that system without the treasure hunt...

Yes, this is really awful world design and self-contradicting, but whatever. John adds one of the "finest warforges" to the party

The party decides to go for the fastest route. The warforge follows us, and somehow deactivates. We leave it behind. John bars us from disecting a warforge for parts. It's almost like someone is reading this while I write it...

Alissa clears the area of anything that can set on fire, and lights a fire. Eve falls into a coma. Again. An hour later, Alissa wakes up Jason to have second watch. Dianne takes third watch. Elizabeth takes fourth watch. Random encounter.

Jasons alarm goes off. Everyone wakes up. Nobody sees anything. Dianne hides. Jason sees rumbling from bushes and a few whispers. Dianne manages to hide in the bush everything else was in. The things draw bows and demand all her money.

Somehow, the thieves teleport out of the place. Somehow. The alarm is triggered by a group of bunnies. The bunnies merge. They ignore Elizabeth.

John makes it walk away because "I'm tired of random encounters". The bunny takes a shit in the middle of camp, making it smell bad.

We all take a long rest, and arrive to a place in ruins, as everyone has left to Mirabar and there's nothing left of value. Even though there's nothing of value, John lets Jason find a great ax. We hear walls crumbling, and a giant growl. 5 orcs, followed by a chief enter.

Alissa manages to continue an already ended encounter. The orcs die even eventually. Everyone levels up.
