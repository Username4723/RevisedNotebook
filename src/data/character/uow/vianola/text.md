Personality | Vi is normally quiet and shy, but isn't opposed talking with others. Once you get to know her, she is quick to open up, though she still prefers more to listen then to speak. However, she often stretches the truth, almost to its breaking point, and can be a tad bit manipulative. In times of crisis, though, she is quick to take the lead, though, and can act as a natural leader.
Strengths   | Acting as a leader (in a crisis), Sitting peacefully out of the way, Manipulating her words, Sketching, Split-second decisions, Seeing the best in people
Weakness    | Academics, Organization, Balance (Physically), Cannot see the worst in people

## Power: Lie Detector

Vi can tell if somebody talking (except her) to her is lying, passively. This can lead to unintended consequences, since as it is passive, it can be hard to disable - a conversation with a compulsive liar can give her a migraine or worse. In addition, it does not flag technically correct statements (You can life the rest of your life underwater!), questions (Have you heard that...?), subjective statements and opinions (___ is the best!), statements the speaker believe as true (but aren't), or other half-truths ("I'm a really good driver. In the past thirty years, I have gotten only four speeding tickets" - said by the person who started driving last week).

## Backstory

Vi's not exactly sure what she wants to do with her life - She believes she's only pursuing higher education due to pressure from her friends (who went to different universities) and parents (who live overseas and don't use technology), though if she was truthful to herself, she'd say she had nowhere else to do; fully unprepared for the workspace and wanting to cling to old habits and friends, Vi saw no other option but to enroll in any university (though she didn't care too much about its reputation - she picked the best university that'd offer her a full-ride scholarship including housing and supplies).

Vi's also a bit naive. She tends to see the best in people, which has led to complications. An example of this was when her highschool boyfriend dropped a "I think I love you..." while slightly intoxicated, which Vi knew to be a lie. She was crushed, but dismissed it as him not knowing what love really was (they were eachother's firsts) and being unsure, and pretended nothing happened in the morning having hoped he forgot. Needless to say, that relationship ended badly when she caught him in bed with someone else.
