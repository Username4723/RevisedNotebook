## Power: Copycat

The user can copy another's power via physical contact. This lasts until the user copes another power. In addition, the user cannot recover a copied power by resting; once they drain a power, they must copy it again. The copied power is somewhat weaker than the original. This does not grant the reflexes, muscle memory, nor training to use the copied power effectively.

# Backstory

Arlen was born to a working class family in a small riverside fishing town. They were by no means poor, but by no means rich either-they supported themselves via their fishing, and no more.

It was only when a mage came to his school that Arlen accidentally copied his power-and even then, he didn't realize it until he blasted himself out of a tree. Quickly after that, he was left his family to go study magic in a city - he was sad at first, but quickly learned how basic explosion magic worked under a mage. This was later undone once he accidentally stumbled into a lightning mage.

It took a few tries, but eventually Arlen figured out his true power-Copycat. It was hard to find a person to train him, as it was a somewhat uncommon ability and not one widely popular at that. However, he eventually learned to somewhat control it. There were a few incidents, however. Arlen occasionally copied a power without knowing it, and wouldn't find out until later. There were times where he went to heal someone, but shocked them instead or vice versa. It was at this time that Arlen was concluding his secondary education, and being confused on where to go, decided to try and find a university to master his power at to ensure he could use it well.
