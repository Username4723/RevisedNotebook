## Powers & Limitations

### Telepathy

The ability to transmit their thoughts to others. This can be done to a select few targets or to a general area. With practice, it can be weaponized by attempting to flood a mind with information.

### Telekinesis [Limited]

The ability to move objects from a distance. This is limited to objects the size of a pillow and no heavier than a sandbag. This requires extreme mental focus when moving multiple objects (ie. the user can't divert their attention at all).

# Backstory

From the moment she was born, Sylvine was special. Most babies cry at birth, but while tears fell, Sylvine's crying was silent. Sylvine did not laugh nor scream. She was pronounced mute in the following days-and likely would remain that way for the rest of her life. Her parents dissapeared shortly after, leaving her a ward of the state.

Sylvine's early schooling was misery. Unable to write well, she often had to resort to crude gestures to communicate-often, these gestures were misinterpreted or simply ignored. Her peers singled her out as an easy target. She would often be tricked, shoved, or pushed, and unable to convey what happened to her.

Eventually, Sylvine learned sign language, although not many people around her cound understand it. When she learned to read and write, her popularity plummeted further-her peers would snap her pencils and steal her paper, and Sylvine could do nothing but watch.

It was winter in her 3th grade year when she first tried to stand up for herself. It wasn't a very bold attempt, and it wasn't successful, either. For her efforts, she earned herself a trip to the floor and a couple of broken bones. She never attempted to do so again.

By 6th grade, Sylvine's belongings were no longer being stolen on the regular - instead, her peers opted to antagonize her. She would be mocked and taunted on the regular, and when she wrote a response (nobody bothered to learn sign language but her), it would be shredded before it was read.

She had no friends and nobody to trust. She kept a diary in secret, hidden in random corners where she thought nobody wound find it. In it, she expressed her hopes for a happier life, her wishes for a friend, and the occasional crush that would likely never notice her.

Sylvine took her poor standing harsly-there were often nights she would cry herself to sleep, and others where she wondered what she did wrong. Throughout this, she took refuge in books and in nature. Reading was a way to escape to a better world, while nature was simply a way to ensure nobody bothered her.

By 8th grade, she learned to reduce her presence - while she was still in a room, she was less noticeable, less memorable. In time, her aggressors found new targets, and Syva could go to school without constant attacks on her self-confidence.

By 10th grade, Sylvine still wasn't sure what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. She spent so much time reading that worries about her future evaded her - she learned what seemed fun and at the time, while still pushing herself academically to lose herself in her work. She still didn't feel ready to commit herself to a role for the rest of her life.

By 11th grade, Sylvine had decided to study magic-while she couldn't use it herself, she loved finding the mysterious patterns it could hold-it was all one game, like a mystery book with a story to tell.

By what would be her 12th grade, Sylvine started to develop her telepathy. Without taking the time to write her words (as still only a handful of people knew sign language), and still less used to her words actually being listened to, Sylvine was quick to speak without thinking about how her words could affect people.

Sylvine had enough credits to graduate early from a combination of advanced classes and go to university. In her diary, she expressed the hopes for a new life, a fresh start, with the possibility of new friends and new experiences. To symbolize this, she took a new name: Syva.
