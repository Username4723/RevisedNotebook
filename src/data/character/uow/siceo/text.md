## Power: Illusions

Siceo can create illusions in a place he can see of up to about a cubic meter at a time, or higher if he is entirely still and focused. The illusions cannot create sound or temperature, and physical interaction with the illusions reveals them to be false. The illusions do reflect light naturally and cast shadows unless made opaque.

He doesn't have a solid grasp of the magic, though, and often fails at fine details. In addition, if motion is involved (such as a perpetual motion machine), the illusion starts to come apart at a rate proportional to the complexity of the illusion and speed of the moved object.

## Anti-Power: Positron

If Siceo touches any device that requires electricity, the device inexplicably breaks in a way that repairing it would cost at least as much as buying a new device. Any microphones or cameras that try to capture him either find him silent or invisible. Rarely, the device will fail catastrophically, such as taking down power for the current building or catching on fire.

# Backstory

Siceo is a very quiet person. Though he has good intentions, due to a violent incident in his past, he does not trust other people with his secrets. He keeps a journal on him at all times, and while he is normally calm and quiet, attempting to read or steal his journal angers him nearly immediately.

In addition, Siceo has always been under immense pressure to succeed, along with immense pressure to "fit in", whether that be in grades, life, or similar. After his parents were arrested and custody of him was released to the state, the pressure on him was lifted immensely. After his parents died in prison, their estate was passed to him, mostly because they did not have time to remove Siceo from their will after they were arrested and before they died.

He is currently studying for law school, as while he could live a lifetime coasting off the interest of his parents assets, while at first he continued because he still felt pressured, as time passed, he started believe he has gone far to turn back, and that turning back would waste all the effort he's put in so far.

Among other reasons, he is studying at --- in specific due to a process-of-elimination. After his parents death, he scratched the university plans his parents set out for him and made his own - deciding on somewhere new to get away from the bad memories.
