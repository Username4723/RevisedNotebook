## Power: Compelled Symphony

Anybody who looks Adney directly in her eyes is forced to activate their power at full force. This effect ends when they leave Adney's field of vision.

## Backstory

From a small fishing town, Adney was forced to fit in, though she did so rather poorly. Eventually, after a former crush of hers (Arla? Relyn? She didn't remember the name too well) left town to study at a random university (she doesn't know where) for an ability they were born with, her temper snapped. Sick of the random chance deciding who's powerful, she vowed she'd write her own story-write her own happy ending. She ran away in the middle of the night, hitchhiking to a random city.

In the city, she broke from her old self - donning a new style, going as far as dying her hair. She also found out about her own power, and decided to buy a pair of glasses to surpress it (which she didn't even knew she needed), and tinted them red for the hell of it. Eventually, she decided to take a few classes, learn a few things, and maybe get a fancy title. _To hell with it. Why not?_ She hitchhiked to yet another random city, as far away she thought, and encountered upon ---.
