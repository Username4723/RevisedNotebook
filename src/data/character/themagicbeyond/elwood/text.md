# Backstory

Elwood originally enrolled in the guard as a young man. During his time in the guard, he was exceptionally good at defending innocents and protecting the poor. When he caught mischief-makers, instead of hauling them off to prison, he often had a talk with them, trying to understand their motives and make sure the offender isn't in a rough spot. He believes that often times, basic human decency can do much more for a desperate person with no other choice than hauling them in front of a magistrate to face consequences can. A majority of the time, he's able to help those forced to crime instead of being forced into action.

As a teenager, he often caused mischief due to having nowhere else to go. Normally, this would end up with a few days in prison, which he was thankful for - it was a bed to spend the night in. He was one of the frequent-fliers in the prison, to such a point where he knew the guards on a first-name basis. Slowly but surely, over a couple of years, the guards helped him piece together his life bit by bit, from the occasional free meal to financial advice to the occasional place to sleep. After years passed, he knew he'd need a stable career. Remembering the guards that helped him, he decided to become a guard himself to pay the kindness forwards.

However, not all guards shared his sentiment. Sometimes, he would be unable to help others as he would like - other guards would jump the gun, or their very presence meant that Elwood wouldn't be able to turn a blind eye to things he'd normally have a small chat about. After a string of particularly painful incidents, he decided to resign from his position on the guard and instead turn towards adventuring. Maybe as an adventurer, he'd be able to help more people, albeit indirectly.
