# Poem

```
The town was dark as night
The people suffering from a blight
When they were put to rest
When the sun sat in the west

Not even two weeks later
From the ground they would awake
Summoned by their dark creator
In search of someone to break

To the people they would go
And chaos they would sow
To the flames the people fled
Or they would join the ranks of the dead
