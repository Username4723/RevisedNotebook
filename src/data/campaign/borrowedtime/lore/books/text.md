# Souls
What is a soul? What is a mind? Which one is truly you? A soul is what keeps one alive - it lies in you. If we accept that an undead is unsouled but with a mind, the mind must be the source of reason. An undead possesses no memory of its former self, so memories must be within the soul. Memories can be altered by mortals, but never permanently - the modification must exist on top of the soul, not within. Therefore, with our mortal bounds, souls are immutable and indestructible, though not uncreatable. -Faraday's Journal, published posthumously.
Rebuttal to Faraday's Theory of Mind and Soul: This theory does not account for Skeletons, an Undead with no soul nor mind. -Published by Maxwell in his "Theory of Soul and Reason"
