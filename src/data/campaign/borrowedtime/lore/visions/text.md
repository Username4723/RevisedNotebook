# Keya's Last Stand

Allyon lay in ruins. The roaring waves of the ocean ripped the docks to shreds, the wind carrying branches and entire trees into the air, and the dark lightning snuffing out anyone who dared try and flee. In the center of town, a young girl, at most 18, stood firm She had golden-blond hair and slightly pointed ears. Her eyes were red, sparkled with silver, and fixed on the ocean beyond. A dark bolt of lightning shot out from the storm, aimed directly at the back of her head, but without even looking, she raised a hand and the flash of darkness shattered into golden light. The girl staggered a bit, a look of fierce determination overcoming her perfectly focused eyes. More and more dark bolts reached for the girl, each one shattering before it reached her. However, each dark bolt got further and further. Finally, a dark bolt reached the girl's heart, and she let out a scream as the storm closed in from all sides. -Vision while Daydreaming

# Wish

Granting wishes is a power that no ordinary mortal can handle. Every wish comes with a price, after all. Only three mortals have ever Wished in recorded history. While one of the Wishers has been lost to time, two others wished for knowledge-knowledge to defeat their enemies, knowledge to achieve their goals, and knowledge to lead them to victory. This knowledge came at a price, however-they knew secrets untold, but lost the wisdom to use them properly. They knew secrets untold, but were no wiser than a child.

# Vathas

He stood by a stream, leaning on his staff. It was raining quite heavily outside, but he didn't seem to care-he was already soaking wet. His back was turned to you, but you could still see his general figure - he was tall, slim, and pale skinned. His golden-blond hair ruffled in the strong winds, but he seemed to have no trouble maintaining his ground, even while small twigs flew by in the breeze. He muttered a few words. The world was illuminated in a flash of lightning, and from across the stream, a figure stood that wasn't there before. - Vision while Daydreaming

# Olympus

Olympus was empty. The home of the gods was deserted, gates bent and thrown right open. Grass was starting to reclaim the paths, and moss and roots were starting to cover the palace. In the throne room, the hearth lay unlit, the thrones of the gods casting dark and ominous shadows. -Observations of a Traveller

# Aeros

Locked away, she cried. All she offered was freedom-the freedom to go wherever you want, to go your own path, to forge your own future. And, for the first time in eons, someone accepted her path, albeit indirectly. This was not to last, though-her follower's mind was soon shattered into Fragments, scattered on the wind. Could this be the mortal have freed her? From the clouds, she cried tears of sorrow. -Dream
