# Food

Food was starting to run scarce. With the Rain, fishing at the docks was no longer safe - the was an everlasting threat of a wave to drag fishermen off the docks and into the thick of the storm. With this, people slowly started to use their spare food. Families rationed, barely satisfying their stomachs. One such family was Tirell and Solange, and their son, Kester, along with their adopted daughter. They were poor even before the Rain, but when they ran too low on food, they had to cut costs-they kicked their adopted daughter to the streets and split the food she would have received between themselves. -Rumors overheard by Mira

From the sky, a warm breeze descended for a brief second. She looked to the sky, and smiled. -Rumors
