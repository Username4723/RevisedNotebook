Emily entered the campaign this session. The storm was revealed as accelerating, and red lightning from the Twelfth illuminated the sky at distinct parts of the session. Peter wandered out to the ruins, only to have to dodge a few flying things, and return to the inn.

Lilian went to Bill's room and read his book, only for Emily to enter, suffocate all the Magic Mouths and rearrange half the room and read all the letters to her.

Emily went to the Twin's cabin, inquiring about where Bill was, only to be shooed off (and fought off) by Corlyn due to her attitude and her (naked) appearance. As she was leaving, she noticed that one of Bill's books was on their bookshelf, and that Bill's footprints led to the ruins, and that Alilvi's footprints went to the ruins and back, as if she was carrying something heavy on the way back.

Brian and Mira, on the other hand, went around to houses and found a sturdy underground bunker - enough for about ten people. They funneled Rose, Edia's parents, the Blacksmith, Nicholas, and his mother into the bunker, after consecrating the body of a dead man (starvation). In other houses, they found dead or starving people, or just empty houses.
