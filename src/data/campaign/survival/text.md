~~The Eagles are coming!~~ No. They aren't. You're on your own.

What was once a prospering country now lies in ruins. It was perfectly normal. And then the grass started to turn brown, then the trees started to rot. Birds fell from the sky. The soil itself dried out, turning to sand in some places. People were weakened, collapsing on the streets. Most did not survive - the weakest turned to dust on the spot. Not even bodies remained. When the survivors awoke, cities and towns were in ruins, buildings destroyed. What were once mighty rivers were reduced to trickling streams. Food was destroyed. People initially tried to share, but eventually fought in the streets over the few limited resources, most of them dying in the process. The party was lost in the woods when this happened. It is currently near the end of fall. The temperatures at night are chilly, but not severely so.

This campaign was pushed back repeatedly until the DM canceled it due to their (at the time) declining mental health.
