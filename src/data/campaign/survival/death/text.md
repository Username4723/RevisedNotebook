--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the Twins fall

With them goes all

Secrets to be revealed

They meet their end on the Battlefield

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From None to Three and then to One

From Twelve to None, it has begun

What has happened before

Will happen again, once more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sacrifice made in vain

A soul drowning in pain

A life lived without love

They rest in the stars Above

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing can stop the Nightmare

The world falling to disrepair

A world with no hope in the sky

Ending in a final goodbye
