What has been done is done

I cannot stop what has begun

Hope begins to crumble away

From the edge it will decay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The weave of Time begins to fray

Without my thread, it will go astray

The Keepers have abandoned their post

I sacrifice myself for what matters most

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A spell made of frost

Begins to truly become lost

A line of old has been torn down

By one who wears the true Crown

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As my sight begins to fade

I begin to feel truly afraid

As my mind starts to Freeze

I look to those who have the Keys
