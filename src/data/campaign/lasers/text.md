Imagine a world with no war. No hate. Peace. Now imagine everything needed to create your utopia. How much money, how many resources, and the immeasurable cost of lives. That utopia exists, but the cost does not. The world was able to achieve near-perfection without the large cost. ~~And everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked~~. But there's a looming threat on the horizon. A ghost of the past so twisted it threatens everything that's ever been.

And you can stop it. You could save the world, or through your actions, doom it. Explore vast castles, large metropolises, desolate wastelands, rural mountains, and fierce battlegrounds. Jump through time and space to find your fate.
