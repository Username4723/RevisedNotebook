A battle raging from the sky / A fate they cannot deny

A future soon to be lost / For peace, what is the cost?

A break from an unending dream / Things are not what they seem

A fate to be soon filled with strife / A quest that could cost your life

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A pair and a costly mistake / A journey to soon undertake

A story and a forbidden love / The burning of the long-lost dove

A story with a start so tragic / A mission to regain their Magic

A final dance to find what was lost / A future, no matter the cost

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An end to an ancient play / An end to a world filled with gray

An evil, so empty and cruel / An opposition that wishes to rule

An epic game starts as a new era dawns / An act with Mortals as Pawns

To halt the war that will end what is real / You must start by repealing the Seal
