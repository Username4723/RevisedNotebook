Once a crew of explorers pushing the fronteir, your crew crossed a boundary that was nigh-indetectable and are now facing the consequences. Stranded on an alien planet with foreign cultures and nations, and even more, magic, you have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

This campaign is an open-world one - and the campaign is the campaign I am most proud of. Like always, it features its own unique history, but this time, it also features its own cultures. In addition, it has a plotline that interacts wonderfully with the open-world nature and encourages exploration.

This campaign hasn't started. If you want to join, message me! Anyone can join, even if you've had me as a DM before and know my tricks
